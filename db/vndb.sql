These vaccines prevented 95% of cases of COVID-19 disease. While the vaccine stops people from getting sick, however, it is not yet clear if it stops them from spreading COVID-19 to other people. It is also not yet known how long they will be immune. So, everyone must still wear a face covering, physically distance, and not gather.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine will be free for everyone and will be offered to different groups in phases. It is likely to be available to the general public in Spring 2021. Please talk to your doctor or sign up for email updates to find out when vaccine will be available to you.\nAs usually happens during a crises, misinformation is circulating about vaccines and scammers are at work trying to cheat people out of their money. See the resources on this page for more information.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nUpdated 02/18/21\nThe vaccine information below was updated on 2/18/21 to give information on COVID-19 vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer only.\n\nExpand all questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Why is vaccination important?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										Vaccination is a safe and effective way to prevent disease. Vaccines save millions of lives each year. When we get vaccinated, we arenât just protecting ourselves, but also those around us.\r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											How do vaccines work?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccines work by preparing the bodyâs immune system to recognize and fight off germs. They reduce your risk of getting a disease by working with your bodyâs natural defenses to build protection.\n\nSome vaccines contain dead or weakened versions of the germ.\nOthers contain substances made to look like part of the germ.\nNew mRNA vaccines (like the COVID-19 vaccines) teach the body to make proteins that look like part of the germ. (See the question âHow do the COVID-19 vaccines work?â for more information).\nThese types of vaccines do not cause the disease they are meant to prevent.\n\nWhen you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. It:\n\nMakes antibodies. These are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease.\nPrepares your immune cells to respond to future infection.\nRemembers the disease and how to fight it. If you are exposed to the germ after getting the vaccine, your immune system can quickly destroy it before you become sick.\n\nThis is what makes vaccines so effective. Instead of treating a disease after it happens, vaccines can prevent us from getting sick in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											How do the COVID-19 vaccines work?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two COVID-19 vaccines that are offered in the United States are called mRNA vaccines. Our bodies use messenger RNA (mRNA) to make proteins.\n\nThe mRNA in the vaccine is packaged inside tiny oily bubbles (known as lipid nanoparticles or LNPs).\nThe mRNA enters the cells and teaches them how to make harmless pieces of âspike proteinâ.  These proteins look like part of the virus.\nOur immune system sees the spike protein pieces on the surfaces of our cells and knows that they donât belong there.\nOur bodies react by building an immune response. It makes antibodies that can act against the COVID-19 virusâs spike protein and it prepares immune cells. This will protect us if we are exposed to the virus in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Can you get COVID-19 from a vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.  After the mRNA teaches the cell to make the protein piece, the cell breaks it down and gets rid of it. mRNA does not enter the cellâs nucleus and mRNA vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA (or genes) in any way.\n The Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines do not have the virus that causes COVID-19 in them. Sometimes people get a fever or feel tired for a day or so after getting a vaccine. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. You can learn more on the Understanding How COVID-19 Vaccines WorkCDC website.\nIt usually takes a few weeks for the body to build full immunity after vaccination. If a person got infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after they got the vaccine they could still get COVID-19. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Will getting the vaccine cause me to test positive on a COVID-19 test?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. Vaccines wonât cause you to test positive on a PCR or antigen viral test (like the swab test) that looks for current COVID-19 infection. You may test positive on some antibody (blood) tests. This is because one of the ways that vaccines work is to teach your body to make antibodies.\nSee the public health testing webpage ph.lacounty.gov/covidtests to learn more about COVID-19 tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											What are the side-effects of the COVID-19 vaccines?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may get side-effects, like the ones after the flu vaccine or shingles vaccine. Side-effects are more common after the second dose and in younger people. They usually do not last long, and you should feel better within a day or two. They may include:\n\nFever and muscle aches\nHeadache\nFeeling tired\nSore or red arm\n\nSide effects are normal and a sign that the vaccine is working. It shows your body is learning to fight a germ and build up immunity.  It is important to get the second dose even if you get side effects after the first dose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											How many COVID-19 vaccines are there?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										Around the world over 50 COVID-19 vaccines are being tested in humans. Two vaccines are allowed in the United States so far. They are made by the companies, Pfizer and Moderna.\r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											How many doses of COVID-19 vaccine will I need?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the COVID-19 vaccines that are being tested are given in two doses a few weeks apart. It is important to get the same kind of vaccine for both doses.\nThe Pfizer vaccine is given as two doses 21 days apart. The Moderna vaccine needs 2 doses given 28 days apart. If you are late getting the second dose, you do not need to start over.\nWe donât know how long the protection from the 2 doses of vaccine will last yet. This also means we donât know if you will need to get a booster dose in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Will I have to pay to get a COVID-19 vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										No. Your doctor or pharmacy may charge a fee for giving the vaccine, but it will be covered by public and private insurance companies. People without health insurance can get COVID-19 vaccines at no cost. There are no out-of-pocket payments.\r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Will I be asked about my immigration status when I get a COVID-19 vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										No. COVID-19 vaccine is being given to Los Angeles County residents at no cost regardless of immigration status. You should not be asked about your immigration status when you get a COVID vaccine. Your medical information is private. Your doctor is not allowed to share it with immigration officials.\r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											When can I get a vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										The goal is for everyone to be able to get a COVID-19 vaccination easily as soon as large quantities of vaccine are available. While supplies are limited, vaccine is being offered to different groups of people at different times (or phases). Visit VaccinateLACounty.com to see which phase you are in, and when vaccines will be offered to each phase. You can also get updates by signing up for the Public Health COVID-19 vaccine email newsletter on this website.  \r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											When it is my turn, where will I be able to get the vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccines will be given at:\n\nHealth clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)\nPharmacies\nSome workplaces\nSome senior housing developments and senior centers\nSpecial vaccination sites run by Public Health and county, city, community, and healthcare partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Why do we need a vaccine if we can do other things, like social distance and wear masks?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										We need to do as much as we can to stop the pandemic. Vaccines boost your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like masks and social distancing, help lower your chance of being exposed to or spreading the virus. Together, these tools offer the best protection from COVID-19.\r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											If I have already had COVID-19, do I still need to get vaccinated?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										Yes. You do need the vaccine even if you have had COVID-19. We donât yet know how long you are protected after you have had COVID-19, so it is important to have the vaccine to strengthen your immunity. It is safe to get the vaccine after getting COVID-19 but you should wait until after your isolation period is over. This is so that you donât infect healthcare workers and others when you go to get vaccinated. If you have had monoclonal antibody treatment, you should wait for 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine.\r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Can children get the COVID-19 vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										No. People under the age of 16 cannot get COVID-19 vaccine at this time. There isnât enough information available yet about the use of these vaccines in children. People age 16 and 17 can get the Pfizer vaccine. The Moderna vaccine is for people 18 and older.\r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Can people with weak immune systems get a COVID-19 vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Studies of the current COVID-19 vaccines did not include people with weak immune systems, so we donât know how well the vaccine will work in these people. We do know that people with weak immune systems are at higher risk of getting COVID-19 if they are exposed to it. If they get COVID-19 they are more likely to become very sick. They are advised to talk to their doctor about getting the vaccine.\nThe studies did include people with stable HIV and people with active cancer, and found that the vaccine was as safe and effective for this group as it was for other people in the studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Can people with allergies get a COVID-19 vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nIt depends. People who are allergic to things like food, pets, venom or pollen, or people who have a family history of allergies, can be vaccinated. But people who have had an allergic reaction to any ingredient in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines or to polysorbate should not get vaccinated. People who are allergic to a vaccine or injectable therapy for another disease, should talk to their doctor to decide if it is safe for them to get vaccinated.\nInformation about allergic reactions may change. Be sure to check the latest guidance on the CDC COVID-19 Vaccines and Allergic Reactions webpage and talk to your doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											What is in the vaccines?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines contain mRNA, lipids (fats), salts, sugars and buffers. Neither vaccine contains eggs, gelatin, latex, or preservatives. For a full list of ingredients, please see each vaccineâs Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Should I get a flu vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\r\n										Yes! A flu vaccine only protects you from the flu, but at least it means you wonât run the risk of getting flu and COVID-19 at the same time. This can keep you from having a more severe illness. Getting a flu vaccine now is more important than ever. If you are likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine soon, ask your doctor about the best time to get the flu vaccine. This is because a COVID-19 vaccine should not be given within 2 weeks of other vaccines.\r\n									\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											What can I do now to help protect myself from getting COVID-19 until it is my turn to get a vaccine?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nTo protect yourself and others, follow these recommendations:\n\nCover your mouth and nose with a mask when you are around others.\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\nAvoid crowds.\nStay at least 6 feet away from others.\nAvoid poorly ventilated spaces.\nWash your hands often.\n\nSee guidance for reducing your risk. You should do this even after you are fully vaccinated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n											Can I stop wearing a mask once I am vaccinated?\r\n											\n\n\n\n\n\nNo! It is important to continue to take precautions like washing hands, wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, even after you have had 2 doses of vaccine. This is because:\n\nTwo doses of vaccine are 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 illness. This is a really high level of protection for a vaccine. But it means there is still a chance that you could get sick with COVID-19, even after getting both doses. We donât know how well the vaccine stops the actual virus from being spread. Getting the vaccine stops the disease from making you feel sick, but you might still be able to spread it to others.\nIt takes up to 2 weeks after the last dose to get the best protection.\n\nIf you get COVID-19 after you have been vaccinated, you still need to isolate.','NA','90067','-',1,NULL,NULL,'2021-02-23 14:33:27','LA County','CA','div|col-md-8'),(16,8,'https://www.miamidade.gov/global/initiatives/coronavirus/vaccine/home.page','Miami-Dade County is coordinating closely with hospital and healthcare partners, the State of Florida, cities, and private partners to vaccinate members of our community against the coronavirus (COVID-19) as quickly, safely, and equitably as possible.\nAccording to state guidelines, persons 65 years of age and older and healthcare personnel with direct patient contact who live in Florida are currently eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.

Please use the outside entrance.\nImportant Vaccine Updates\nPlease read these important updates on the vaccine rollout. This will be updated regularly.\nUpdates from the State of New Jersey\nUpdate from Morris County: 1/15/21\n\nTo register for a vaccination appointment at the Morris County Regional COVID-19 Vaccination Center, go to: https://bit.ly/3onkSkC\nEffective, January 14, individuals 16-64 with certain medical conditions, as defined by the CDC, and individuals 65+ are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in New Jersey. These individuals join health care workers, individuals in high-risk congregate care settings, and first responders as eligible.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for persons 16 years of age and older under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization, however the Moderna vaccine is recommended for individuals 18 years and older. Not all sites administer both vaccines, so it is important to check with your vaccination site before scheduling a visit to ensure you are eligible.\nThe Morris County Regional COVID-19 Vaccination Center is switching to Pfizer as of Jan. 15, 2021. Important to note:  The vaccine may change again, depending on what is made available to the center.\nIndividuals who are pregnant and those in an immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant are also eligible but should follow CDC guidance and first discuss vaccination with their medical provider before receiving the vaccine.\nSmoking is included as a risk factor on the CDC list of high risk conditions and individuals 16-64 with a smoking addiction are now eligible for the vaccine. Smoking put individuals at higher risk for more severe disease. If an individual who smokes get COVID, they face a significantly high risk for severe complications, mechanical ventilation, and death.  Our goal is to save as many lives as possible and to promote vaccination among the groups at highest risk. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US as well as in NJ (except for COVID-19). We encourage anyone who smokes to quit, and to seek support through our Quitline at www.njquitline.org\nVaccinations are available to individuals who live, work, or are being educated in New Jersey. So some individuals who are not NJ residents may be vaccinated in this State. Some county-operated sites may restrict vaccination at their locations to those who work, live, or are being educated in their county. However, the State encourages all vaccination sites to make appointments available to all eligible individuals.\nResidents of group homes and long-term care facilities are currently eligible for a vaccine and permitted to schedule an appointment at an open vaccine location.\nAn announcement regarding the remainder of essential workers and individuals at high risk who will be eligible under Phase 1B and Phase 1C will be forthcoming.\nThe movement between vaccination eligibility phases is fluid. One phase may overlap with another- not all individuals in one phase will be vaccinated before opening to additional groups.\nInformation about the number of doses administered in the State and demographic information can be found on the COVID Dashboard.\nThe State of New Jersey will open a consumer call center to assist individuals without internet access in scheduling appointments, and will assist in answering general inquiries and questions.\nThe vaccination of individuals in high-risk, congregate care settings such as nursing homes, assisted living residences, IDD group homes, etc. is expected to take weeks. Doses for these settings have already been reserved in the State’s allocation. These efforts are primarily driven by the Federal Pharmacy Partnership LTC program (Walgreens/CVS) who is prioritizing vaccination in skilled nursing facilities/nursing homes and assisted living residences first. Those in other congregate care settings are a priority but may not have been contacted by the pharmacy program or DOH on their status yet.\nHealth care workers eligible in Phase 1A include paid and unpaid persons working in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to infectious material – regardless of their employment status, professional credentials, or the setting where care is provided. There is no exhaustive list of each eligible health care worker-this was intentionally broad so the State does not exclude anyone who should otherwise be eligible.\nIndividuals who are providing paid or unpaid health care services, like essential caregivers (i.e. a daughter caring for her elderly mother with severe neurological disorder in her home instead of her mother receiving care in a nursing facility) are currently eligible for the vaccine as health care workers.\nCOVID-19 vaccines will be made available to individuals regardless of insurance coverage status. Individuals won’t pay coinsurance, deductibles, or copayments. Providers that administer vaccinations to patients without health insurance or whose insurance does not provide coverage of vaccination administration fees may not charge enrollees directly for any vaccine administration costs.\nAll members of the public can be directed to the NJ COVID-19 Information Hub, covid19.nj.gov, for information about vaccination eligibility and how to make an appointment.\n\n\n \nEligibility\nNew Jersey is rolling out the vaccines in a phased approach until large quantities of vaccines become readily available.

As vaccines are available, we will contact those who meet the State’s 1B criteria, and in accordance with our equitable allocation framework, to schedule an appointment. Currently, the Pfizer vaccine is only approved for people age 16 and older and the Moderna vaccine is approved for those 18 and older. We will work diligently to communicate with those who meet the State’s 1B criteria, and in accordance with our equitable allocation framework, to provide the vaccine equitably.\nPlease see below for a list of frequently asked questions and resources.

If you do not have a MyChart account, please call 877-361-0111 Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 5 p.m.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow can my child receive the vaccine?\nAs vaccines are available, we will contact those who meet the State’s 1B criteria, and in accordance with our equitable allocation framework, to schedule an appointment.\nWhich vaccine are you administering to patients?\nCurrently, we will administer both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Vaccines are allocated by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) and patients will receive one of these two products.\nAs a parent or caretaker, will I also be eligible to receive the vaccine at Texas Children’s?\nCurrently, we will only administer the vaccine to our patients who meet the State’s vaccination criteria.\nCan my child’s siblings also receive the vaccine at Texas Children’s?\nCurrently, we will only administer the vaccine to our patients who meet the State’s vaccination criteria.\nCan my child receive the vaccine if they have symptoms of COVID-19?\nIf your child has symptoms of COVID-19 or is currently considered a close contact of someone with COVID-19, vaccination should be delayed until they have recovered from their illness and criteria is met for them to discontinue isolation.\nShould my child receive the vaccine if they have already had COVID-19?\nYes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages vaccination regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nWhen will children younger than 16 be able to receive the vaccine?\nAt this time, the Pfizer vaccine is only approved for people age 16 and older and the Moderna vaccine is approved for those 18 and older, as the early clinical trials did not include children and younger teens. We are hopeful children and younger teens will be eligible in the future once additional safety and efficacy data is available.\nWhich vaccines are currently available?\nThere are currently two vaccines whose manufacturers have received authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. for emergency use. The first, produced by Pfizer and BioNTech, is authorized for people age 16 and older. The second, produced by Moderna, is authorized for those 18 and older.\nWhat is in the vaccines?\nBoth vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) packaged inside lipid nanoparticles to teach the immune system how to generate antibodies against one of the proteins on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so the virus can’t enter your cells. This technology has been used before to develop vaccines against SARS, which is how the manufacturers were able to develop and move these vaccine candidates into clinical trials so quickly.\nDo the vaccines work?\nEfficacy of two doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine is 95%. This means, in clinical trials, the vaccine prevented approximately 95% of COVID-19 disease in people who were vaccinated, and only approximately 5% of vaccinated people developed COVID-19 disease. Additionally, efficacy of two doses of the Moderna vaccine is 94.1%.\nAre they safe?\nFrom preliminary data, we know mild side effects are common. We know if you’re vaccinated, you should expect to experience some side effects, particularly after the second dose. These side effects are common and may occur after any vaccine. Although uncomfortable, these side effects are a sign that your immune system is responding to the vaccine and is learning to recognize the virus for the future. The short-term safety of these vaccines is clear.\nCan a COVID-19 vaccine make me sick with COVID-19?\nNo. The vaccine only contains the genetic instructions to make a protein of the virus. It does not contain a whole virus that can replicate inside of your body. So, the vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19.\nHow long will the vaccines work?\nWe don’t know yet. As clinical trials progress, we’ll know more about how long immunity lasts and if booster doses will be necessary. Please remain vigilant to the practices which have proven successful throughout the pandemic – wear a mask in all settings, wash your hands frequently, maintain social distancing and avoid large social gatherings.\nWhat can I do if my child is not feeling well?\nIf your child is experiencing a cough or fever, or if you have questions about COVID-19, please schedule a virtual appointment with your Texas Children’s® Pediatrics pediatrician or Texas Children’s® Urgent Care.\n\nBlogs\nCOVID-19 vaccines: Answering the big questions (December 14, 2020)\nPregnancy, breastfeeding and the COVID-19 vaccine (December 23, 2020)\nAdditional resources\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nFacts about COVID-19 Vaccines\nFrequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 Vaccination\nBenefits of Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine\n		 \n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nCOVID-19 Vaccines\nCOVID-19 Educational Resources\n\nIn the News\nPregnant women should get COVID-19 vaccine, US doctors say, despite conflicting international advice – CNN\nProgress in the fight against the coronavirus is coming, but Texas is a long way from herd immunity – Texas Tribune\nCOVID-19 Vaccine experiences from around the US – The Wall Street Journal\nNew COVID variants are going to ‘hit us pretty hard,’ says Dr. Peter Hotez – CNBC\nCDC supports in-person instruction, according to new research – NBC 2 KPRC\nCOVID-19 vaccine trials didnt include pregnant women.

Once you receive an invitation, you can choose whether to schedule an appointment.\n\n\nIf you have seen a Northwestern Medicine primary care or specialty care physician via a telehealth visit and meet other established patient criteria, you are considered an established patient. However, if you have only been to an Immediate Care Center or Emergency Department, you are not considered established.\n\n\nNorthwestern Medicine is identifying and proactively contacting patients who are eligible to schedule COVID-19 vaccination appointments. We are following federal, state and local guidelines throughout this process. Patients are contacted through their preferred communication method: email, text message and/or phone call. You can update your contact information and preferences through the MyNM patient portal at nm.org/mynm.\nIf you receive a communication from Northwestern Medicine about scheduling, please make your appointment as soon as possible, following the instructions given. This allows us to efficiently use all doses of the COVID-19 vaccine that we receive. You can make an appointment for vaccination at any Northwestern Medicine facility that is available at the time of scheduling.\nWe will continue to contact established Northwestern Medicine patients and update this page with new information.\n\n\nUpon scheduling, you will see a list of available vaccine clinic locations. Once you select a location, you will be provided with instructions on where to go for your appointment. \n\n\nIf you have a MyNM account (formerly known as MyChart), you will receive a notification in your email. If you do not have a MyNM account, we will contact you the same way you receive your appointment reminders — by phone, text message or email.\n\n\nNorthwestern Medicine patients who receive an invitation are encouraged to open and use their MyNM account to schedule their vaccination appointment. You can find instructions to set up a MyNM account here. If you do not have a MyNM account, your invitation will include an access code and a link to a website to use for scheduling. Once you enter the access code, you will be able to select the date, time and location of your vaccination appointment. Please note that the access code is for one-time use and is unique to you. \n\n\nIf you have questions about scheduling your COVID-19 vaccine appointment once you’ve received an invitation, please call the COVID-19 Vaccine Hotline at 312.694.6600 (TTY: 711).\n\n\nYou will not be able to reschedule the appointment online. If you need to reschedule, please call 312.694.6600 (TTY: 711).\n\n\nWe are following specific criteria for scheduling established Northwestern Medicine patients based on available vaccine doses. If your spouse or family member meets that criteria, they will receive a separate invitation to schedule. Your invitation is only for you.\n\n\nNorthwestern Medicine continues to invite and prioritize established patients based on age and those living in high-hardship ZIP codes that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. High-hardship ZIP codes are defined by a variety of indicators and conditions, including unemployment, poverty, per capita income, housing, education and the dependency and care of a child younger than 18 or adult older than 64.\n\n\nPatients who regularly see a physician who is part of the Northwestern Medicine Physician Network (NMPN) are eligible to be invited for a COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\nSince vaccine supply remains limited, you are encouraged to schedule an appointment at designated vaccination sites. Use the following links to find locations near you: \n\nState of Illinois\nCity of Chicago\nCook County\nDeKalb County\nDuPage County\nKane County\nLake County\nMcHenry County\nWill County\nCVS \nHy-Vee \nJewel-Osco\nKroger\nMariano’s\nMeijer\nWalgreens\nWalmart\n\n\n\nMany Illinois counties now have information or registration forms for the public to subscribe to vaccination updates, including the following in Chicagoland:\n\nCity of Chicago\nCook County\nDeKalb County\nDuPage County\nKane County\nLake County\nMcHenry County\n\nYou can also find a full list of vaccine sites for the State of Illinois.\nFederal, state and local governments continue to refine plans for vaccination, including eligibility decisions and availability of doses. At this time, vaccine supply is still limited. Eventually, there will be enough vaccine doses for everyone who chooses to be vaccinated.\n\n\nNorthwestern Medicine is currently focused on vaccinating patients 65 and older. Front-line essential workers are encouraged to register for COVID-19 vaccination at a community-based vaccination clinic. For example, health departments and pharmacies are now offering the vaccine, and the Illinois National Guard will run large vaccination clinics in Cook County.\nFront-line essential workers include:\n\nFirst responders \nEducators, including teachers, principals and school support staff\nChild care workers\nHomeless shelter staff\nGrocery store employees\nUnited States Postal Service employees\nPublic transit workers\nFood and agriculture workers, such as those who work in processing plants\nVeterinary employees \nCorrections workers and inmates\nThose who work in manufacturing\n\nFor vaccination at an Illinois National Guard site, you must schedule an appointment on the Cook County Community Vaccination Program website.\nA comprehensive list of Illinois vaccination locations can be found on the State of Illinois Vaccination Location web page. You can search for locations by city or ZIP code. You may need to fill out information verifying that you are eligible for an appointment, and bring proof of eligibility to the appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for Your Vaccine Appointment \n\n\n\n\n\n Where can I see my COVID-19 vaccine appointment details? \n May I choose which vaccine I receive? \n Do I need to bring identification to my vaccine appointment? \n What should I wear to my COVID-19 vaccine appointment? \n Where can I get documentation regarding my COVID-19 vaccination? \n\n\n\nIf you make your appointment through MyNM, you will find your appointment details there. If you do not have a MyNM account, you will receive an email confirmation with the appointment details after scheduling.  \n\n\nNo. Northwestern Medicine offers both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines. We cannot control how many doses of each vaccine we receive, so your vaccine type will depend on what is available on the day you come for your appointment. Your second dose will be the same vaccine as your first. \n\n\nYes, please bring an ID and your insurance card. There will be no out-of-pocket cost to be vaccinated.\n\n\nPlease wear a short-sleeved shirt or clothing that provides easy access to the upper arm.\n\n\nAt your appointment, you will be given instructions on how to access your vaccination record via MyNM. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Dose Information \n\n\n\n\n\n How do I schedule my second dose of the vaccine? \n I did not receive an appointment for the second dose at my first vaccine appointment. What should I do now? \n I cannot make my scheduled appointment for the second dose of the vaccine. How do I reschedule? \n What happens if I miss the 21- to 28-day window for my second dose?  \n Can I get my second dose at a different location than my first dose? \n I had my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and then tested positive for COVID-19. Can I still get the second dose of the vaccine? \n\n\n\nWe will schedule you for your second appointment when you receive your first dose.\n\n\nPlease contact the number that was provided in your invitation to schedule your second dose. \n\n\nThe vaccine supply from the CDC and local health departments is based on the number of people who need the second dose of the vaccine. Please make every effort to keep your scheduled appointment. If you cannot, please call the number that was provided in your invitation to discuss your options.\n\n\nThe second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine should be given as close to the recommended date as possible. However, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, if you must delay your second appointment, the second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. If you need to change the date of your second appointment, please call 312.694.6600.\n\n\nNo. We ask that all patients ensure they can go to the same location for both doses when scheduling their first appointment. This is because we cannot guarantee that the same type of vaccine you received for your first dose will be available at another location. \n\n\nYes. You will need to complete your 10-day quarantine period before you receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. If you need to reschedule your appointment, please call the hotline number that was provided in your invitation.','No content','60611','https://www.nm.org/patients-and-visitors/nm-mychart |\n251 E Huron St, Chicago, IL 60611, Estados Unidos',1,NULL,'2021-02-23 00:08:06','2021-02-23 03:17:14','Northwestern Memorial Hospital','IL','div|col main-content md-9'),(64,12,'https://hospital.uillinois.edu/primary-and-specialty-care/infectious-diseases/covid-19-coronavirus/vaccine','COVID-19 Vaccine\n\n\nThis page will be updated when more information becomes available about how to schedule your vaccine appointment.

When we receive vaccine from the state, we open our website for people in the community to register. Vaccine is currently available only for those in Phase 1A and Phase 1B according to State of Texas guidelines. Because we are limited by vaccine supply, the open spots are typically filled within hours. As we get more vaccine, we often are able to invite those who have already filled out the form but didnt receive an invitation (thereby on the \"waitlist\"), as well as reopen registration.\n \nOur goal is to continue our outreach to the hardest hit neighborhoods in our city and our most vulnerable patients, as well as keep vaccinating our employees, physicians and first responders. These groups do not need to sign up through the hub, but will be contacted instead by Houston Methodist.\n \nIf you have accessed a Houston Methodist doctor or service in the past two years, please do not use the hub to sign up for a vaccine. Instead, we will contact you by text, email or phone when we reach your vaccine priority group, based on the criteria listed below.\n\n \nImportant COVID-19 patient vaccine plan\nHouston Methodist is also offering the vaccine to at-risk, vulnerable patients who meet specific criteria. \n \nWe are currently notifying eligible patients via automated phone call, text message, email or regular mail to schedule their vaccine:          \n\n1.

You can access MyChart without a code by clicking on “No Authentication Code?” on the screen. \nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nWhat is the vaccine hub?\nThe state included Houston Methodist in its program to vaccinate a large number of our city’s most vulnerable members. As such, when we receive vaccine from the state, we open our website for people in the community who meet current eligibility guidelines to register. Vaccine is currently available only for those in Phase 1A and Phase 1B according to State of Texas guidelines. Because we are limited by vaccine supply, the open spots are typically filled within hours. Our goal is to continue our outreach to the hardest hit neighborhoods in our city and our most vulnerable patients, as well as keep vaccinating our employees, physicians and first responders. \nWhat happens if I filled out the vaccine hub form but I didnt get an appointment?\nUnfortunately, we cannot immediately  accommodate everyone who fills out the form due to the limited supply of the vaccine. As we get more vaccine, we often are able to invite those on the waitlist, as well as reopen registration. \nI heard the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer vaccine? What does that mean?\nThe FDA issued an EUA for the Pfizer vaccine on Friday, Dec. 11. In an emergency, like a pandemic, the FDA can make a judgment that it’s worth releasing something for use even without the typical timeline for a new vaccine or drug. According to a press release issued by the FDA, the FDA determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information.\nIs it safe?\nBefore the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization, the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was reviewed by panels of independent experts retained by the companies; by FDA scientific staff; and by an independent panel of experts convened by the FDA. There are no reported serious safety concerns from this vaccine. The CDC and the FDA will continue to monitor individuals who have received the vaccine to ensure there’s no evidence of even rare safety issues.\n \nPlease also keep in mind that COVID-19 can be a fatal or debilitating disease, even in young healthy people. The risks from contracting the virus are greater than the possible risks from receiving the vaccine.\nCan I get COVID-19 from the vaccine?\nNo. It is not possible to get COVID-19 from vaccines. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use only a gene from the virus while other vaccines being studied use inactivated virus. None of these can cause COVID-19.\nAre the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna basically the same?\nWhile both are mRNA vaccines, there are several differences between the two: \n\nThe two vaccines have different age requirements. You must be at least 18 years old to receive the Moderna vaccine and at least 16 years old to receive the Pfizer vaccine. \nThe waiting period between the two vaccines is different. You must wait 21 days between your first and second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and 28 days between doses for the Moderna vaccine.\nThe Pfizer vaccine requires a much colder storage than the Moderna vaccine. \n \n\n \nFor questions specific to the Pfizer vaccine click here, and for questions specific to the Moderna vaccine click here.\nWhich vaccine is better between Pfizer and Moderna?\nBoth vaccines have shown to be very effective at preventing COVID-19 infection. The Pfizer vaccine has shown to be 95% effective across all age, racial and ethnic groups. The Moderna vaccine has shown to be 94.1% effective across all racial and ethnic groups, but this number did appear to be a little lower among those 65 years of age or older.\nNow that the Moderna vaccine has received EUA from the FDA, will I be able to choose between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine?\nNo. Supplies are still too limited to allow you to choose between the two vaccines. You will be given the vaccine that we have available at the time you are vaccinated.\nAre the vaccines interchangeable? If I get the Pfizer dose first, can I get the Moderna dose second?\nNo. You must receive the related second dose for the vaccine to work appropriately. You cannot interchange the two vaccines as they are not exactly the same.\nWhat if I am concerned about my side effects from any of the vaccines?\nPlease seek medical attention immediately by calling your doctor’s office or setting up a virtual visit if you experience severe side effects.  \nShould I wait to get a vaccine until all of the vaccines are approved, and can I pick which one I want?\nClinical trials indicate that the Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective and the Moderna vaccine is 94% effective, both with minimal side effects, so we recommend that you get the vaccine as soon as it is offered to you to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are effective, and we would not recommend one over the other or waiting until other vaccines currently in the pipeline have been approved. There are also no guarantees that any of the other vaccines will be made available to us in the near future. We advise you to take the vaccine that’s made available to you and not to wait.\nI have a health condition that prevents me from getting vaccines with live viruses. Do you know if the COVID-19 vaccine uses a live virus?\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines are mRNA vaccines, and AstraZeneca’s and Johnson & Johnson’s are non-replicating vectored vaccines. None of the early vaccines being tested are live weakened versions of the virus. When vaccines are licensed, part of the information that will be provided will include who should or should not get each vaccine. We recommend talking with your health care provider to determine which vaccine will be the best one for you, given your medical history.\nIf I have had COVID-19 should I get the vaccine?\nYes. COVID-19 infection does induce immunity, but it induces less of an antibody response than the vaccine. The antibody response to the vaccine is dramatically higher than it is to natural infection. We are seeing reinfection among people who have already been infected with COVID-19, so the vaccine should provide additional protection against reinfection. \nWill the vaccine be given annually like the flu shot?\nWe are studying this now and we don’t think this will be an annual vaccine, but we are not sure yet. We will let you know as soon we know. \nDo I have to continue wearing a mask after I get the vaccine?\nYes. We should continue wearing masks, practicing excellent hand hygiene and social distancing until enough vaccine is manufactured and distributed, until we know how long a vaccine will protect us, and until our community shows levels of minimal spread. \nWhat risks should I consider if I’m pregnant and trying to decide if I should get the vaccine?\nYou should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission; your personal risk of contracting COVID-19; the risks of COVID-19 to you and potential risks to the fetus; the efficacy of the vaccine; the known side effects of the vaccine; and the lack of data about the vaccine during pregnancy. We recommend that you reach out to your health care provider to help you make an informed decision. \nShould I get the vaccine if I’m breastfeeding?\nThere is no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women or the effects of mRNA vaccines on the breastfed infant or milk production. According to the CDC, mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant. If a lactating woman is part of a group that is recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, she may choose to be vaccinated. We recommend that you reach out to your health care provider to help you make an informed decision. \nIf I get sick after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, should I still get the second shot?\nUnless you develop a contraindication to the vaccination, you should complete the series even if you develop the expected post-vaccination symptoms in order to optimize protection against COVID-19, according to the CDC. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose\nHow long will it take for the vaccine to begin protecting me?\nAccording to the CDC, it will take approximately one to two weeks following the second dose to be considered fully vaccinated.\nShould I get the vaccine if I’ve had a severe allergic reaction to vaccines in the past?\nNo. People who have had a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine should not receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at this time.\nWill I be monitored for any side effects after I receive the vaccine?\nYes. Vaccine providers will observe patients after administering the vaccination to monitor for immediate adverse reactions. People with a history of anaphylaxis will be monitored for 30 minutes, and everyone else receiving the vaccine will be monitored for side effects for 15 minutes.\nShould I get the vaccine if I am immunocompromised?\nThere is currently not enough data available to establish the vaccine’s safety and efficacy for immunocompromised people. People with HIV infection, other immunocompromising conditions, or people who take immunosuppressive medications or therapies might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. These individuals may still receive the COVID-19 vaccine unless otherwise contraindicated. We recommend that you reach out to your health care provider to help you make an informed decision. \nWhat risks should I consider if I’m immunocompromised? \nAccording to the CDC, you should consider the unknown vaccine safety and efficacy profiles in immunocompromised people, the potential for reduced immune responses, and the risks of becoming ill with COVID-19, as well as the need to continue to follow all current guidance to protect yourself against COVID-19.\nCan a person already sick with COVID-19 receive the vaccine?\nThe vaccination should be deferred until the person recovers from an acute illness (if the person had symptoms) and has met the criteria to discontinue isolation. As soon as your acute symptoms resolve you can be vaccinated.\nShould people who previously received antibody therapy for COVID-19 receive the vaccine?\nThere is no data on the safety or efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccination in people who received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment. According to the CDC, the vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days to avoid interference of the treatment with \nvaccine-induced immune responses.\nShould people with underlying medical conditions receive the vaccine?\nYes. The vaccine may be administered to people with underlying medical conditions who have no contraindications to vaccination. Phase II and phase III clinical trials demonstrated similar safety and efficacy profiles in people with underlying medical conditions, including those that place them at increased risk for severe COVID-19, compared to people without comorbidities.\nShould I take Tylenol or Advil before the vaccine to minimize my possible side effects?\nNo, it is not recommended at this time due to a lack of information on the impact of use on vaccine-induced antibody responses. Antipyretic or analgesic may be taken for treatment of post-vaccination symptoms.\nGETTING THE VACCINE FROM HOUSTON METHODIST\nWhen will Houston Methodist receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\nWe began administering the vaccine to our first group of employees on Dec. 15. \nIf family members of patients admitted at Houston Methodist hospitals can prove they received the COVID-19 vaccine, will they be allowed to visit a Houston Methodist patient?\nNo. The vaccine is not 100% effective, and we must do everything we can to protect our patients, including enforcing a strict visitor policy. \nIs there a government registrar for those who receive the vaccine, and if so, what information will the government require from Houston Methodist? \nYes, vaccine providers are required to provide certain data elements for every dose administered within 24 hours of administering it to the state’s vaccine registry. This is the same vaccine registry that we report our current vaccines to, such as Hepatitis B, and the security of that data complies with federal and state laws governing confidentiality and privacy. \nI got a text message, email or phone call notice that I was eligible for the vaccine, but my significant other or child didn’t. Why?\nThere are not enough vaccines for everyone right now. To be fair in the distribution of vaccines, we developed a tiered system; the patients and community members who are most in need and could benefit the most from the vaccine have the opportunity to receive it first.\nTo create this tiered approach, we used guidelines from the National Academy of Medicine, the State governor, the CDC and Health and Human Services, and published studies. We will expand the pool of eligible patients and community members who can receive the vaccine as soon as more vaccines become available.\nWhat signs should I be concerned about? When should I call a primary care physician (PCP)?\nCall your primary care physician if you experience:\n\nLightheadedness\nDizziness and/or weakness \nA rash on your body \nSwelling of your face and/or throat\nFever between 99.5-101 degrees Fahrenheit\nSore throat, congestion or runny nose\nChills\n \n\n \nCall 911 or go to the nearest Emergency Department if you experience:\n\nWorsening, severe difficulty breathing, or unusually fast heartbeat\nTrouble waking (or becoming confused in a way that’s new)\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest\n\nI’d like to make an appointment with a primary care physician. How do I find one and make an appointment?\nTo identify a primary care physician or if you have any questions, please click here or call us at 346.803.2915. Or, if you prefer, you can schedule a virtual appointment here from the comfort of your home.\nDoes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Food & Drug Administration monitor my health in any way?\nYes. V-safe is smartphone-based app tool that uses text messages and web surveys where you can quickly tell the CDC if you experience any side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine. Click here for more details on downloading their app. \nWhere do I find proof of my vaccine?\nAfter you receive your initial and booster doses of the vaccine, it will be recorded in MyChart. If you do not have a MyChart account, you can register as a new user here.\nYou do NOT need an authentication code to sign up. You can access MyChart without a code by clicking on “No Authentication Code?” on the screen.\n For assistance, please call us at 832.667.5694, Monday-Friday from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m.\nGENERAL VACCINE QUESTIONS \nWhat is a vaccine?\nAccording to the CDC, a vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies and cellular immunity to combat that specific disease, like it would if you were actually exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease without having to get the disease first. This is why vaccines are necessary — they prevent disease by letting you develop immunity in a safe and controlled way.\nHow does the vaccine for COVID-19 work?\nPfizer and Moderna’s vaccines use novel messenger-RNA, or mRNA, technology, which uses genetic material to cause the body to create a protein from the virus, allowing the immune system to recognize the virus and attack it. These will be the first mRNA products to be approved by the FDA. The studies have enrolled 43,538 volunteers and 38,955 have received their second dose. About 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. In Pfizer and BioNTech’s late-stage clinical trial, 50% of the volunteers got the vaccine, while the other half got a placebo of saltwater. Then they waited to see who would get sick. Only 170 volunteers out of 44,000 have so far gotten sick with COVID-19. An independent board of experts looked at the placebo group and vaccine participants and reported that the vaccine is 95% effective. See this story to learn more about mRNA vaccines. And this story from Time Magazine gives a great overview. See this infographic for a quick study on how the mRNA vaccine works.\nAre there other vaccines being studied?\nThe AstraZeneca and University of Oxford team, as well as Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, are also working on vaccines but using different technology for delivering the viral genes that can produce viral proteins to activate the immune system. Novavax and the Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline are working on a vaccine that uses proteins themselves to trigger an immune response. All are close to completing their testing. For up-to-date information on all the vaccines, please see testing of their shots. To track the vaccine trials, please see this updated tracker in the New York Times.\nWill the vaccine keep me from getting COVID-19?\nCurrent data show that both the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna vaccine are 95% effective in preventing a person from getting COVID-19. The studies did not test everyone to see how many people in the vaccinated group got infected compared with the placebo group. Instead, the scientists compared how many in the vaccinated group and the placebo group went on to develop disease. The companies will continue to test people in the studies for antibodies to the COVID-19 virus, which would include people who did not show any symptoms of their infection, so they can get a better sense of whether or not the vaccines protect against not only getting sick, but also against infection.\nAre there challenges with the distribution?\nThese vaccines will require two doses and need to be kept at very low temperatures, much colder than a household freezer. Many hospitals and clinics do not have the ability to store the medicine at these ultra-low temperatures, so that must be worked out. At Houston Methodist, we have ample cold storage facilities to hold whichever vaccine we use for patients and employees. And during distribution we still need to keep the vaccines cold and the temperature strictly monitored, making the distributing challenging. However, Houston Methodist has teams working on our plans for this and we are prepared to store and safely distribute the vaccine we receive. \nI’m concerned that this “experimental” vaccine is being rushed. Is the FDA overseeing this?\nYes, it is. The FDA is expediting clinical trials for vaccines because of the importance to stop the spread of COVID-19. However, the FDA is following its processes and only issued the EUA for the Pfizer vaccine after it determined it safe and that the manufacturer conducted the trials properly. Remember that safety is paramount at Houston Methodist – for both our patients and our staff. We are hopeful that the vaccine will help keep you, your family and our patients safe by keeping you healthy. \nWill getting the flu vaccine protect me from COVID-19?\nA flu vaccine will not protect you from getting COVID-19, but it can prevent you from getting influenza (flu) at the same time as COVID-19. This can keep you from experiencing a more severe illness. While it’s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the winter, CDC believes it’s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 will both spread during that time. You should encourage all of your friends and family to get flu shots, just like we have at Houston Methodist.\nWill COVID-19 vaccines cause me to test positive on COVID-19 viral tests?\nNo. These vaccines will not cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection. As your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, it is likely you will test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests currently indicate you had a previous infection or vaccination and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently studying how COVID-19 vaccination will affect antibody testing results and whether performing these tests are useful in determining an individual’s immune status to COVID-19.\nWhat are the odds I’ll still catch COVID-19?\nAccording to the CDC, we won’t know how long immunity lasts until we have a vaccine and more data on how well it works. Both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are trying to learn more about. The CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.\nDo the new vaccine trial results mean the end to the pandemic?\nIn the short term, no. The soonest that coronavirus vaccines could become widely available to the public would be in the spring. But if effective vaccines become available — and if most people get them — the pandemic could drastically shrink. This means we are one giant step closer to getting our lives back \nto normal. \nWill people who have gotten sick with COVID-19 still benefit from getting vaccinated?\nDue to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID-19 is possible, people may be advised to get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID-19 previously. At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called natural immunity, varies from person to person and the evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long in some people.\nYou can download a PDF of these frequently asked questions here.\nLearn More About COVID-19 Vaccines\nRead our latest On Health blog articles on the COVID-19 vaccine:\n\nHerd Immunity: How Many People Need to Get the COVID-19 Vaccine?\nHow Was the COVID-19 Vaccine Developed So Fast?\nCOVID-19 Vaccines: What About Side Effects?\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Distribution: Rehearsing Our Rollout Plan\nHeres What We Know About COVID-19 Vaccine Safety\nWhen Can You Expect the COVID-19 Vaccine to Be Available to You?\nDistributing the COVID-19 Vaccine: An Inside Look at Our Planning Process\nHow mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Work\nWhy the COVID-19 Vaccine Needs to Be Kept So Cold (& What This Means for Its Availability)\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Q&A: Your Questions, Expert Answers\n\n \nOther Helpful Resources\nLearn all about COVID-19 vaccines in development and vaccination planning in the United States and in Texas:\n\nCDC General COVID-19 Vaccine Information\nFDA COVID-19 Vaccine Information\nTexas COVID-19 Vaccination Plan\nDSHS Immunizations Unit: COVID-19 Vaccine Information\nPfizer Coronavirus Vaccine\nModerna COVID-19 Vaccine','No content','77030','6565 Fannin Street Houston, TX  77030',1,NULL,'2021-02-23 09:49:13','2021-02-23 09:49:13','Houston Methodist Leading medicine','TX','div|img-wrapTxt col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 WithLine'),(70,45,'https://www.valleyhealthlink.com/patients-visitors/coronavirus-covid-19-updates/covid-19-vaccinations/','Patients & VisitorsCoronavirus (COVID-19) UpdatesCOVID-19 Vaccinations\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccinations\nSecond Dose Appointments\n\n	Both types of COVID-19 vaccines currently available require a second dose.\n	For more information on second doses, please visit:\n		valleyhealthlink.com/seconddose.\n\nFirst Dose Appointments\n\nAt this time, we do not have first dose appointments available.

Please make sure you are registered in the AllVax system so we can notify you when you can schedule your appointment. Vaccinations at long-term care facilities in Lake County began on December 28, 2020. These are vaccinations are being done by Walgreens and CVS through a federal program. Phase 1b: Adults Ages 65 and Older and Frontline Essential WorkersSome local hospitals, healthcare providers, pharmacies, and other partners began giving vaccines on a limited basis to Phase 1b, adults ages 65 and older and frontline essential workers, on January 25. This phase will continue for several months. A map of local providers is available on the State of Illinois website.The Lake County Health Department is offering appointments to seniors ages 65 and older at the Lake County Fairgrounds. Please make sure you are registered in the AllVax system so we can notify you when you can schedule your appointment. Until vaccine supply increases, Lake County will not be expanding to the \"Phase 1b plus\" group announced by the Governor, which includes people ages 16–64 with co-morbidities, high risk health conditions, and disabilities. Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for transitioning between phases, we will look to move in to the \"Phase 1b plus\" group when 60-70% of persons within the current phase are vaccinated or when supply of vaccines exceeds demand in the current phase. However, pharmacies and other entities that receive vaccines directly from the state or federal government are free to follow the Illinois expansion that begins February 25, 2021.Click here for a detailed list of people in each phase.

The order in which people may receive the vaccine is based on criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The Health Department will be providing some vaccination services. Additionally, the Health Department will partner with some outside clinics and entities to provide more vaccination opportunities for those that live and/or work in Lake County. All providers interested in administering the COVID-19 vaccine must sign up for I-CARE.

In a Closed POD, an employer (if eligible) or a third-party vaccine provider (more common) registers in the State’s I-CARE program. The Lake County Health Department distributes vaccines for administering to eligible employees either on-site or at a partner location.The most common Closed POD involves employers contracting with a third-party vaccination provider. These are often companies that provide contract occupational health, employee wellness, and onsite flu clinics.Steps for Developing and Operating a Closed PODView a list of occupational health partners for COVID-19 vaccineDisclaimer: The Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center is in no way responsible for, does not endorse, and is not affiliated with any of the listed organizations.

Currently the PSA can be seen on CBS network, YouTube and on the Cook County Health Facebook page.\nLearn more about vaccination efforts through the COVID-19 Community Vaccination Program.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccination Phases and Plans\nCook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) has been preparing since the pandemic started to make the COVID-19 vaccine available as soon as possible to people living and working in CCDPH’s jurisdiction of suburban Cook County. Evanston, Oak Park, Skokie and Stickney Township have their own state-certified local health departments and are not part of CCDPH’s jurisdiction.\nCCDPH has expanded to Phase 1b of the Vaccination Plan as of January 25. We will continue to prioritize any remaining Phase 1a individuals.\nThe expansion to Phase 1b includes members of the general public for the first time – about 375,000 people aged 65 and over. The 65+ population represents a majority of people within phase 1b. Phase 1b also includes police, firefighters and other essential workers, such as manufacturing employees and grocery store workers – a group estimated at 270,000.\nCCDPH has released a registration form for community organizations (such as adult daycare, community center, employer, senior housing, shelter, place of worship, or other large institution) that would like to work with CCDPH to organize on-site vaccinations. A mobile vaccination unit may be sent to your site to run an onsite vaccination clinic to vaccinate ONLY pre-registered staff/residents/clients. Given that vaccine supply is highly limited, CCDPH will prioritize requests based on COVID-19 impact and vulnerability.\n\nTo qualify for mobile team assistance, you must:\n\n\n\nEmploy or serve individuals in Phase 1b with limited resources or access to care within suburban Cook County (excluding Evanston, Skokie, Oak Park, or Stickney Township).\nHave a secure space to conduct vaccination while maintaining social distancing\nSupport clinics for COVID-19 vaccination doses 1 and 2\nSupport setting up appointments and pre-register staff/clients\n\n\n\nTo register, please visit the Community Vaccination Program website, and click the “Organization Sign-Up” link on the right side of the menu bar.\n\n \nCCDPH’s vaccine plans\nCCDPH is committed to an equitable distribution of vaccine, with an emphasis on communities that have been most dramatically impacted by COVID, and traditionally underserved populations. Our strategies and decisions are driven to earn the trust of every resident.\nIn order to meet the need of these Phase 1b residents or workers CCDPH is adding significant capacity to our community vaccination plan distribution plan – CCDPH is distributing vaccine to a total of 91 sites including Cook County Health centers, large capacity sites around the county, 40 Walgreens locations, other pharmacies and county hospitals.\nCCDPH is significantly expanding its capacity to provide vaccine to larger numbers of people each week and we hope additional vaccine is sent to us to accommodate that ability.\nCOVID vaccine will rollout in phases\nVaccination for COVID-19 in suburban Cook County will be rolled out in phases, based on national guidance.

Three locations — one in the north, west and south suburbs of Cook County — have been activated. EMS personnel have been notified and have started to make appointments and receive the vaccine.\nVaccine supply is expected to continually increase in the weeks and months ahead. CCDPH will work with partners to ensure those that are the most vulnerable have access COVID vaccinations. Eventually, the vaccine will be available to all suburban Cook County residents who want it.\nMore information about Cook County’s COVID-19 Vaccination Plan is available in this presentation.\nFor the latest information about COVID vaccine development and CCDPH’s vaccine distribution plan, click here.

Governor Kathy Hochul said the state has the systems in place to handle all the vaccinations given to them from the federal government -- but the challenge is the supply.  \n\n\"The second the tide turns and there are more vaccines, there will not be delays,” said Hochul.  \n\nShe told reporters based on the current calculations, it will take seven months to handle phase 1a and phase 1b before they get to the general population. \n\nHowever, Hochul is hopeful there will be some changes to help expedite that. \n\nFor example, a new administration is starting this week and the governor has inquired about getting Pfizer to sell directly to New York State. \n\n\"That would be a game-changer,\" Hochul explained. \"If we can get a direct supply from Pfizer to take care of New York State, we would be very busy ramping up all of our locations and staffing them, but we have resources that are untouched right now.\"  \n\nPfizer, however, has already dismissed the idea, and made that clear a day before Hochuls remarks. \n\n2 On Your Side also asked the Lt. Governor about the state opening up more vaccine clinics downstate when appointments are being canceled in Western New York. \n\nHochul said, \"New York State is being very equitable about this. There is a very rigid formula based on the population of an area.\" \n\nShe added, \"There is no favoritism whatsoever in the distribution.\"   \n\nHochul also said she knows the process of getting an appointment is frustrating and shes urging people to be patient. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\nSeniors need help navigating NYS system to get COVID-19 vaccine\n\n\nCuomo: Federal COVID-19 vaccine rollout creating public chaos\n\n\n \nUB is beginning its vaccine clinic today.

Supply from the Federal Government is extremely limited. Additional New Yorkers will become eligible as the vaccine supply increases. While the vaccination process is underway, every New Yorker should wear a mask, social distance and avoid small and large gatherings.\nOver seven million New Yorkers are now eligible for the vaccine. Eligible groups include doctors, nurses and health care workers, people age 65 and over, first responders, teachers, public transit workers, grocery store workers and public safety workers. \nBeginning February 15, New Yorkers with certain comorbidities and underlying conditions will be eligible to receive the vaccine.\nVaccines are available at pharmacies, hospitals and through local health departments statewide – please contact your provider of choice to schedule your vaccine appointment. You can use this website for scheduling a first-dose appointment at a New York State-run site only. To determine eligibility and schedule a first-dose appointment at one of these sites, use the Am I Eligible app. Remember: Both vaccines require two doses for effectiveness. Your second-dose appointment will be scheduled automatically at the time you receive your first vaccine dose. Appointments are not transferrable.\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Tracker\n\nInstructions for New York State-Operated Vaccination Sites:\nStep 1: Determine eligibility and schedule an appointment. The Am I Eligible app is the quickest way to see if youre eligible and make an appointment. You can also call the New York State COVID-19 Vaccination Hotline at 1-833-NYS-4-VAX (1-833-697-4829). Once you have successfully scheduled an appointment, you will receive a confirmation email that contains a barcode. You will need to bring this to your appointment.\nStep 2: Complete the Vaccine Form. Once you have a confirmed appointment, you must complete the New York State COVID-19 Vaccine Form. This form should be filled out online and you will receive a submission ID indicating completion. You will need to bring the submission ID to your appointment. If you cannot submit the form online, it will be available at the vaccination sites.\nStep 3: Bring proof of eligibility to your appointment. Depending on your eligibility category, proof can include an employee ID card, a letter from an employer or affiliated organization, a pay stub, a drivers license, passport, or any legal proof of your date of birth and residency. At the time of your appointment, youll be asked a series of clinical questions to ensure readiness for a vaccine. You will be asked for insurance information BUT the vaccine is free and there will never be a charge to you. This information is for administrative use only.\nStep 4: Your second dose appointment will be scheduled automatically when you receive your first vaccine dose. Your second appointment will be scheduled for the same time and at the same location, three weeks following your first dose. You will receive a card onsite with the date and time indicated and a confirmation email will follow a few days later. Please keep in mind when scheduling your first appointment that your second appointment will occur at the same time of day.\n\n\nX\n\n \nGET DAILY COVID-19 AND VACCINE UPDATES\nSign up here','No content','10013','-',1,NULL,'2021-02-25 15:20:33','2021-02-26 08:56:33','New York State','NY','div|paragraph paragraph--type--webny-wysiwyg-pgtype paragraph--view-mode--default'),(109,43,'https://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/salt-lake-city','At Shriners Hospitals for Children, the health and safety of our patients, families, volunteers and staff is our top priority.

Typically, they use dead or weakened parts of the disease, known as antigens, to trick your immune system into thinking there’s an intruder in your body. Your cells then create antibodies to fight and destroy the antigen. Because your body will remember how to make these antibodies, it will be ready to react if you are exposed to the live virus.\nBoth COVID-19 vaccines use an innovative new approach. Instead of using dead or weakened antigens, the vaccine introduces your body to COVID-19s messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). In response, your cells make a piece of a protein that is found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. Because your body does not recognize this protein, it will immediately begin making antibodies to destroy it. Your immune system will then remember how to fight the COVID-19 virus if you are exposed to it later.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDoes it matter which vaccine I get?  \n\n\n\nBoth the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines are equally effective (about 95% effective), so it doesn’t matter which one you get. But the vaccines are NOT interchangeable. So your first and second doses will need to be made by the same company. The two vaccines also have slightly different intervals between doses (21 days for Pfizer/BioNTech and 28 days for Moderna).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow strict is the recommended time between doses?  \n\n\n\nThe recommended interval for both vaccines should be followed whenever possible:\n\nPfizer/BioNTech: 21 days\nModerna: 28 days\n\n\nThat said, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say you can receive your second dose up to four days early. AMITA Health’s experts encourage you to receive your second dose no later than four days after the recommended interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan a vaccine that was created this quickly be safe?  \n\n\n\nGiven the widespread impact on health and safety, medical and research scientists worldwide have placed unprecedented collaborative focus on developing a COVID-19 vaccine. While this vaccine is available faster than what is typical, the COVID-19 vaccine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization, and has passed clinical trials and rigorous testing to help ensure that it is both effective and safe.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDo AMITA Healths medical experts think the vaccine is safe?  \n\n\n\nAMITA Health is committed to the health and safety of all patients, visitors, community and staff. Our physicians support the FDAs efforts and believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhat are the risks of the vaccine?  \n\n\n\nThe FDAs rigorous testing helps ensure that vaccines are safe. However, all medications (including vaccines) carry a low risk of side effects. Most common side effects are identified in clinical trials before the vaccine is approved, but less common side effects may not be detected until the medicines or vaccines are more widely available. Thats why vaccines are continuously, carefully monitored for possible side effects even after they are approved.\nThe most common reported side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine include pain and swelling on the arm where you receive the vaccine. Some recipients have also experienced mild fever, chills, fatigue and headache.\nIf you experience side effects after your vaccination, please bear in mind that this is normal. It means your immune system is working properly. These side effects should go away in a few days. Contact your healthcare provider if your side effects increase or do not go away after a few days.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCan I get vaccinated if I’ve already had COVID-19?  \n\n\n\nYou can and you should. Research shows it’s rare for people who have had COVID-19 to get reinfected within 90 days, but you would not need to wait 90 days for your vaccination:\n\nIf you’ve had COVID-19 with symptoms, you can get the vaccine once you no longer have symptoms\nIf you were asymptomatic, you can get the vaccine 10 days after a positive PCR test\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCan I get vaccinated if I’m pregnant or breastfeeding?  \n\n\n\nYes, according to researchers at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). A pregnant woman can pass immunity on to her baby. However, a conversation with your doctor beforehand might be helpful if you are pregnant or planning to get pregnant.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIf I receive the vaccine, can I stop wearing a mask and social distancing?  \n\n\n\nNo, continued use of a mask, social distancing and washing your hands frequently is highly recommended until the vaccine is received by the majority of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the flu vaccine cover COVID-19, too?  \n\n\n\nNo. The flu vaccine is important to protect you from influenza, particularly during the current coronavirus pandemic, but it does not vaccinate you from COVID-19. Receiving a vaccine is important to stay healthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got the flu vaccine and still got the flu. How do we know the COVID-19 vaccine is effective?  \n\n\n\nAnnual flu vaccines are challenging because the strains of influenza virus that are prevalent change each year. In addition, there is a two-week period for the vaccine to reach its full effect. In some cases, getting a vaccine does not prevent illness, but for most people, it does. This is why the seasonal flu vaccine’s effectiveness is between 40–60%, according to the CDC.\nCompare this to the two COVID-19 vaccines that have received FDA emergency use authorization, which appear to be about 95% effective in preventing the infection. Moreover, early data from Public Health Englands SIREN Study suggests that even a single dose can reduce the risk of infection by more than 75% and interrupt viral transmission. Vaccinated people who do get infected are far less likely to die or be hospitalized; early data shows a reduction of more than 75%.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Prevention & Wellness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Variants: What Everyone Should Know\nVariants of the novel coronavirus have come to the U.S. Learn about what these variants do — and what you can do first.\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Do While You Wait for the COVID-19 Vaccine\nAs you wait for your turn to get the COVID-19 vaccine, dont lose sight of your physical, mental and emotional health.\nRead Article\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Holiday Safety Tips\nMay your days be merry and bright with our medical expert’s advice for celebrating the season safely.\nRead Article\n\n\n\n\n\"COVID Fatigue\" and How to Fight It\nEmotional fatigue caused by COVID-19 is real and affects us all.

Additional information will be provided as that vaccination effort begins\nWe will share updates once we are authorized by public health agencies to vaccinate larger groups of patients. Contact your local public health department for alternative vaccine locations if you are not currently eligible to receive a vaccine through our patient program.

Patients who are eligible to receive vaccines will be automatically entered into a lottery that follows public health guidelines. Patients do not need to take action to be added to the pool and will be notified though MyChart messages, texts, and/or phone calls if and when it is their turn to schedule a vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen will I know if I can get a COVID-19 vaccine from UChicago Medicine?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUChicago Medicine will contact patients as we learn more about distribution plans and determine when we can begin to broadly vaccinate patients. You also can check this webpage for updates. When patients are eligible for a vaccine through our automatic lottery, they will get a message through MyChart, texts, and/or a telephone call when it is their turn. Lottery enrollment is automatic, and patients will not need to take action to be added to the pool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho will be able to get vaccinated first from UChicago Medicine?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, we will invite current patients who are 75 and older and who live within the South Side’s 15 ZIP codes we serve to be vaccinated. After that, we will expand to those who are 65 and older and are from the same communities. Then we will expand further into the greater Chicagoland area. In all phases, we will use a lottery. We will continue to provide the vaccine in an efficient and orderly manner and are committed to using all doses provided to us. This initial distribution process, which may be revised, was developed in consultation with ethicists, health disparity experts, clinicians and many others. We look forward to expanding our patient program as public health agencies grant us permission for more widespread vaccination. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere will patients go to get their COVID-19 vaccine?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccines will be given to patients in our vaccine clinic on our Hyde Park medical campus.

The ability of COVID-19 vaccines to protect us from spreading the virus to others is not yet known, but is being studied carefully.\nRead more at CDC’s Benefits of Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine.\nHow they work\nVaccines help our immune system fight infections in the future. COVID-19 vaccines will protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19 without having to get the illness.\nIt typically takes a few weeks after the last dose in a series to become fully protected. On the days after taking the vaccine, you may have a sore arm, aches, fatigue or fever, but these are not harmful. These symptoms signal that your immune system is developing protection from the virus.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n \n\n繁體中文\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMenu - Secondary\n\n\nOur Response to COVID-19\nCOVID-19 Testing Services\nCOVID-19 Vaccine\nWhat You Need To Know\nHow You Can Help','No content','94133','845 Jackson St, San Francisco 1-415-982-2400',1,NULL,'2021-02-26 14:21:54','2021-02-26 14:37:41','Chinese Hospital','CA','div|content-sidebar-wrap'),(128,31,'https://www.northwell.edu/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine','','No content','10075','100 E 77th St New York, NY',1,NULL,'2021-02-26 14:42:31','2021-02-26 14:42:31','Lenox Hill Hospital','NY','div|'),(132,4,'https://www.ucsfhealth.org/covid/vaccine','COVID-19 Information for Patients & Visitors \n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccines at UCSF Health','No content','94143','505 Parnassus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94143, United States',1,NULL,'2021-02-26 15:46:07','2021-02-26 15:46:07','UCSF Health','CA','div|component article-hero basic-hero'),(133,31,'https://www.rumcsi.org/about/covid-19-support/covid-19-vaccinations/','Home » About » COVID-19 Support » COVID-19 Vaccinations\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccinations\n\nRichmond University Medical Center is providing COVID-19 vaccines on a scheduled basis and in accordance with all New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) guidelines.

They will then receive a MyChart activation code within three to four business days to start the process of booking an appointment.We will keep the registration portal open until all appointments are booked. Once 10,000 people sign up, we will briefly pause registration. Those individuals who entered their information and meet the eligibility requirements can be assured of receiving their first of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine within a three-week window.Eligible UTSW patients who are seeking vaccination and who have been seen by one of our providers within the past three years should continue monitoring their MyChart accounts for available appointments. Once you log in to your account, click the orange \"Schedule a COVID-19 Vaccine\" icon under the Quick Links section to get started. UTSW patients should not sign up through the portal. Please see the “How to schedule a COVID-19 vaccine via MyChart” tip sheet for more information.We continue to coordinate with state and local leaders. Additionally, we have opened a vaccination site at RedBird Mall in southern Dallas, providing more convenience for eligible individuals who live and work in that area. We hope to offer more locations in North Texas as our supply of vaccine increases.Our public vaccination sites, available by appointment only, are:UT Southwestern West Campus Building 3 (ninth floor), 2001 Inwood Road, Dallas, TX, 75390 (driving directions and parking information)Market Hall, 2200 N. Stemmons Freeway, Dallas, TX, 75207RedBird Mall, 3550 W. Camp Wisdom Road, Dallas, TX, 75237As a state-designated vaccination hub, we are currently vaccinating Texans who meet Texas Phase 1B criteria, which include a number of chronic medical conditions. We are also offering vaccines to individuals with other conditions identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as potentially high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 infection, including asthma, hypertension, and dementia.Unfortunately, like most distribution sites across the nation, we are limited in how many people we can vaccinate based on the supply of vaccine we receive. We are committed to ensuring that the doses allocated to us are given to those who have the highest risk factors.Our goals remain threefold: To improve awareness of the benefits of vaccination, increase access to available supply, and provide those who register with UTSW a definitive timeline for when they will be vaccinated.','No content','75080','3030 Waterview Pkwy, Richardson, TX 75080, United States',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 05:31:02','2021-02-27 05:53:40','UT Southwestern Richardson / Plano','TX','div|wysiwyg_text wysiwyg_text_rightCTA'),(149,42,'https://www.dallascounty.org/covid-19/vaccine-landing.php','No content','No content','75240','8202 Spring Valley Rd #200, Dallas, TX 75240, United States',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 05:31:47','2021-02-27 05:54:48','Dallas County Health and Human Services North Dallas Immunization Clinic','TX','div|perc-region perc-region-leaf perc-fixed perc-vertical col-lg-12'),(150,12,'https://www.boonecountyil.org/government/departments/health_department/index.php','Home Government Departments Health Department\n\n\r\n\r\nHealth Department\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur MissionThe mission of the Boone County Health Department is to serve our community by preventing the spread of disease, promoting optimal wellness & protecting the publics health. Hot Topics    Coronavirus (COVID-19)If you have general questions regarding the 2019 Coronavirus pandemic, also known as COVID-19, please call our COVID-19 information line at 815-547-8561 or email us at: COVID19@boonehealth.orgAppointments for COVID-19 Vaccinations are available at multiple locations in Boone County for residents age 65 and older.

In 1985, Boone county voters passed a referendum allowing the county to levy a tax in support of public health. The department has since met the criteria necessary to be designated as a certified public health department by the Illinois Department of Public Health.\nBoone County Board of HealthA volunteer, 11-member Board of Health is appointed by the county board chairman and approved by the county board. Illinois state statute requires the board include: two physicians, a dentist, a county board representative, and interested community members. These volunteers serve 3-year terms and represent the community at large. The Board of Health governs health department operational issues such as the annual budget and the development of policy and procedures.  For Board of Health meeting dates, minutes, and agendas, \n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1204 Logan Avenue\nPhone #:  815-544-2951\nEmail Health Department\n\n\nBelvidere, IL 61008\nFax #:  815-544-2050\nHours: M-F 8:00a.m.-4:30p.m.','No content','61008','BELVIDERE 1204 LOGAN AVE 61008',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 05:32:02','2021-02-27 05:33:46','BOONE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT','IL','div|col-md-9'),(151,42,'https://forms.cooperaerobics.com/acton/fs/blocks/showLandingPage/a/2187/p/p-0342/t/page/fm/0','No content','No content','75230','12200 Preston Rd, Dallas, TX 75230, United States',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 05:32:28','2021-02-27 05:56:05','Cooper Clinic','TX','div|ao-block  ao-form-block'),(152,42,'https://www.bswhealth.com/covid-vaccine','Baylor Scott & White is now vaccinating Texans who meet Phase 1A and Phase 1B criteria, as informed by state and federal guidanceUpdated','No content','75093','1100 Allied Dr, Plano, TX 75093, United States',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 05:33:45','2021-02-27 05:57:03','Baylor Scott & White The Heart Hospital - Plano','TX','div|col-xs-12 video-hero__content'),(153,46,'https://www.walgreens.com/findcare/vaccination/covid-19','No content','No content','80249','18550 Green Valley Ranch Blvd Denver, CO',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 05:34:19','2021-02-27 05:34:19','Walgreens','WA','div|couponWidget'),(154,12,'https://www.bchealthdepartment.org/','PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!!\nYou will be denied vaccination if you are not in Phase 1b, Part 1: Individuals 65+ or Essential Worker. \nBelow is a link to a COVID-19 Vaccination Clinic being held on Tuesday, March 2nd at the Bureau County Fairgrounds for 1st dose, Phase 1b Essential Workers and Individuals 65+ ONLY.

To sign up for a vaccine, visit your local county public health department website or call the number provided there.\n\nCollin County\nDallas County\nDenton County\nTarrant County\nOther Texas counties\n\nCommunity members pulled from public health waiting lists and assigned to Texas Health will be scheduled for vaccine appointments at a Texas Health Community Clinic.\nTexas Health Physicians Group also has a limited vaccine supply for phase 1B primary care patients. Eligible patients will be contacted by their THPG physician’s office as vaccine supplies allow. THPG patients do not need to sign up on a wait list at their physician’s office or call the office.\n\n\n\nHow to Register for an Appointment in North Texas\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Sign up for the Wait List\n\nVisit North Texas county websites to sign up for that county’s wait list if available.\n    \nCollin County\nDallas County\nDenton County\nTarrant County\nOther Texas counties\n\n\nYou do not have to be a resident of the county to sign up. But you must be willing to drive to that county when your appointment is set.\nIf you are signing up more than one person, each person must register separately. You can use the same email address if necessary.\nCheck your email, text messages or voicemail for confirmation that you are on the wait list.\n\nStep 2: Get Your Appointment \n\nVaccine supply and demand determine how long it will take to get your first appointment.\nIt may take several weeks or more for an appointment. Most county websites provide a way to check your status on the list.\nWhen your appointment is set, the local vaccine provider will contact you with the date, time, and location. In some cases, you may get only 1 or 2-days’ notice. That is why it is important to check your email, text messages, and voicemail daily to be sure you don’t miss the appointment.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Get Your First Dose \n\nTexas Health offers vaccines at Texas Health Community Clinics by appointment only. You can find locations here.\nBring your photo ID to your appointment.\nAt this time, only those with appointments will be seen. The clinics do not take walk-ins.\n\nStep 4: Get Your Second Dose (Pfizer and Moderna Vaccines)\n\nIf you get your vaccine at a Texas Health Community Clinic, in most cases your second dose will be scheduled at your first dose appointment. Should that not occur, watch your email for your second dose appointment confirmation. \nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines need two doses for best results.\nYou will go to the same place for your second vaccine dose as you did for the first.\nYour second dose must be the same brand as your first dose.\nImportant!

And we do that by keeping our spaces clean. That is our commitment to you.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE — June 2020\nA Letter from Our President & CEO\nMoving Forward: A Hospital Within a Hospital\nWe hope you and your family are in good health. We have all been through a lot these last few months and are all looking forward to resuming more normal routines. While many things have changed, one thing remains constant: TBHC’s commitment to Keeping Brooklyn Healthy\nOur healthcare workers have heroically fought on the frontlines of the COVID-19 battle, and we remain here for those who continue to come in with COVID. But we also need to return to providing care for those patients getting a knee replaced, seeking relief for a painful spine debilitation, or considering life-preserving weight-loss surgery. We serve our community’s healthcare needs in a myriad of ways. As COVID-19 remains in the community until a vaccine is created, we know you have a multitude of questions about how TBHC will continue to deliver safe, effective and compassionate care. Let’s tackle those questions here:\nWhat do you mean by a hospital within a hospital?As soon as it is allowed by the State of New York, TBHC will phase in elective surgeries and procedures. Because TBHC continues to manage COVID-19 patients, the hospital has created a “COVID-safe” environment by organizing the hospital into separate areas with distinct access points, designated waiting areas, staff, nursing units and equipment. We will be effectively treating the needs of both sets of patients in separate and safe models of care.\nWhen is the hospital transitioning to this new model?TBHC is already performing a number of urgent and emergency surgeries and procedures following best practices around COVID screening and safety protocols. Full capacity for elective surgeries and procedures is anticipated for the near future.\nHow will the Emergency Room handle COVID safely?The Emergency Room will safely handle both COVID-19 and non-COVID cases in the following ways:\n\nEveryone, staff and patients alike, must wear masks. If you do not have one, you will be provided with one.\nWhen you arrive, you will be screened for possible COVID-19 or other contagious illness.\nIf it is determined your condition is not related to a contagious illness:\n\nYou will be directed to our waiting area, which will only allow patients with non-contagious illness. There, you will be asked to observe social distancing according to marks on the floor or staff direction.\nYou will be treated in a safe and separate treatment area for all your emergencies not related to a contagious illness. We have and will maintain this safe zone at all times, even during a crisis.\n\n\nIf it is suspected you have a contagious illness, you will immediately be taken to a safe and separate evaluation-treatment area.\nWe also have a safe, separate evaluation and treatment areas for pediatric emergencies with its own separate entrance.\nFurther note that all staff will at all times wear masks and gloves and frequently wash their hands. Staff who register you will be behind a plexiglass shield to keep all safe and protected.\nOnly one caregiver is allowed with a patient. Caregivers will also be screened. To protect everyone’s safety, visitors will be limited and authorized on a case-by-case basis, depending on the emergency.\n\nWho will be screened and tested for COVID-19?\n\nAs a precaution, all patients and visitors will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms at all access points to the hospital and ambulatory sites.\nAs of April 24, all admitted patients are tested for COVID-19.\nTBHC has initiated antibody testing for all front-line employees.\nTelemedicine visits are available for patients, as well as COVID-19 screening.\n\nHave you cleaned the hospital well?Every room and public area in the hospital is cleaned and disinfected daily following a rigorous infection protocol. Patient, procedure and operating rooms are intensively cleaned and disinfected to the highest levels. The walls and floors are disinfected, and everything is stripped from the room. The crew sweeps through on a clockwise rotation to make sure nothing is missed. As a final layer of protection, each room is misted with a deep-cleaning chemical to kill any remaining virus.\nWhen are the TBHC ambulatory sites opening?\n\nAmbulatory sites are now open with modifications to ensure your safety.\nAppointments are being scheduled to assure that a safe number of patients are allowed in the waiting room at any one time and that social distancing can be maintained at all times by both patients and staff. Masks are required to be worn by all patients and those accompanying patients at the visit. All staff are wearing masks, as well.\nOnly one parent or caregiver is allowed with a patient, including one for an elderly or handicapped patient, and one to accompany a pregnant woman during prenatal visits.\nPatient exam rooms will be closely monitored throughout the day and disinfected as needed. The waiting areas and common areas will be cleaned and disinfected periodically during the day and each evening.\n\nWhat further assurances are there for non-COVID-19 patients who require elective surgeries or procedures at TBHC?\n\nAll staff working in pre-surgical testing and perioperative areas are being screened and tested for COVID antibodies.\nAll patients will be provided with an appropriate mask if they do not have one at their appointment.\nThere will be separate PACU (recovery) and nursing units for COVID-19 versus non-COVID patients\nTBHC has adequate and separate ICU capacity and staff for both COVID-19 and non-COVID patients.\nAll patients will be tested for COVID-19 48 hours before surgery/procedure.\n\nIf positive and symptomatic, the procedure will be rescheduled.\nIf positive and non-symptomatic, TBHC will proceed with the case.\n\n\n\nStay safe and be well,\nGary G. TerrinoniPresident and CEOThe Brooklyn Hospital Center\n\nUPDATE — May 4, 2020:Effective, May 4, the COVID-19 screening tent outside the emergency room will close.​ If you want to learn more about your risk for COVID-19 or have questions about testing, please call the Community Hotline at 718-250-8199.\n\nUPDATE — APRIL 15, 2020:TBHC Blood Bank is seeking plasma donors who have recovered from COVID-19.

Continued social distancing,\n	 avoiding contact with those who have been exposed or are confirmed positive\n	 of COVID-19, properly wearing a face mask in public and practicing hand\n	 hygiene are still enforced guidelines by CDC and the State of Texas to\n	 help slow and stop the spread of COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 Vaccine FAQs\nHow does an mRNA vaccine work?\nmRNA vaccines have strands of genetic material called mRNA inside a special\n	 coating. That coating protects the mRNA from enzymes in the body that\n	 would otherwise break it down. It also helps the mRNA enter the dendritic\n	 cells and macrophages in the lymph node near the vaccination site.\nmRNA can most easily be described as instructions for the cell on how to\n	 make a piece of the “spike protein” that is unique to SARS-CoV-2.\n	 Since only part of the protein is made, it does not do any harm to the\n	 person vaccinated but it is antigenic.\nAfter the piece of the spike protein is made, the cell breaks down the\n	 mRNA strand and disposes of them using enzymes in the cell. It is important\n	 to note that the mRNA strand never enters the cell’s nucleus or\n	 affects genetic material. This information helps counter misinformation\n	 about how mRNA vaccines alter or modify someone’s genetic makeup.\nOnce displayed on the cell surface, the protein or antigen causes the immune\n	 system to begin producing antibodies and activating T-cells to fight off\n	 what it thinks is an infection. These antibodies are specific to the SARS-CoV-2\n	 virus, which means the immune system is primed to protect against future\n	 infection.\nIs the COVID-19 vaccine safe?\n\n	The U.S. FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech\n	 and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, which have been shown to be safe and effective\n	 determined by data from large clinical trials. While vaccines are being\n	 developed as quickly as possible, routine processes and procedures remain\n	 in place to ensure the safety of any vaccine that is authorized for use.\n	 The CDC continues to monitor adverse events through safety monitoring\n	 systems. Click\n	here for more information on the CDC and safety monitoring. (Source:\n	CDC, Ensuring the Safety of Vaccines &\n	Benefits of Getting Vaccinated)\n\nWill the vaccine give me COVID-19?\n\nNo. According to the CDC, none of the authorized and recommended COVID-19\n	 vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines currently in development in the U.S. contain\n	 the live virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\n	(Source:\n	CDC, Facts about Vaccination)\n\nWho should not get the vaccine?\n\n	You should\n	not get the COVID-19 vaccine if you:\n\n\nhad a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or\n		 have had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredients of the vaccine.\nhad an immediate allergic reaction, even if it was not severe, to any ingredient\n		 in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.\nhave had an allergic reaction to PEG (polyethylene glycol) or polysorbate.\n		 Polysorbate is not in the vaccines but closely related to PEG which is included.\n\n\n	(Source:\n	CDC, Allergic Reactions)\n\nIf you are pregnant, plan to be pregnant or breastfeeding, please talk\n	 to your doctor before getting vaccinated.\nIf you have already recovered from COVID-19, there are no recommendations\n	 by CDC on whether or not to get vaccinated. There is not enough information\n	 available to say if or for how long after COVID-19 infection someone is\n	 protected from getting it again (natural immunity). If you are currently\n	 infected with COVID-19, please wait until you have completed your quarantine\n	 period and are not experiencing symptoms before getting vaccinated.\nIf you have questions or concerns on whether to be vaccinated, please talk\n		 to your doctor.\nWhat are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?\nThe most commonly reported side effects of the vaccines include:\n\nInjection site pain and swelling\nTiredness\nHeadache\nChills\nFever\n\nIf you experience any of these side effects, these are normal signs that\n	 your body is building protection and should go away in a few days. The\n	 CDC still recommends getting the second shot even if you experienced side\n	 effects after the first shot, unless a vaccination provider or your doctor\n	 tells you otherwise.\n\nEach individual that is vaccinated should report their side effects in the\n		v-safe health checker platform right away.\n\n\n	(Source:\n	CDC, After Getting the Vaccine)\n\nYour Safety is Our Top Priority\nYou may be concerned about news of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and\n	 its implications for your health and those of your loved ones. Your safety\n	 and well-being are our top priority.\nPlease know that:\n\nWe are taking all necessary measures and precautions to protect the safety\n		 of our patients and staff.\nWe specialize in the care of patients with complex illnesses and have experience\n		 with managing and containing novel viruses.\n\n		This is a rapidly evolving situation and we suggest you check out the latest\n		 updates on the\n		CDC website as well as the website of your\n		state health department and\n		Dallas County Health and Human Services.\n\n\n		Hospital visitor policies have been updated to reflect national efforts\n		 to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. This policy may change at\n		 any time due to the rapidly evolving situation.\n		\nOnly virtual visits will be allowed for COVID-19 positive patients or Persons\n				 Under Investigation (PUI).\nVisitors to other areas of the hospital are limited to one person per day.\nEmergency Room patients will be limited to one visitor per visit.\nAll visitors will undergo a health screening. Cleared visitors will need\n				 to wear a wristband and face mask at all times.\nFace masks should be changed daily.\nVisitors should stay in the patient room at all times, unless they are\n				 visiting the cafe or parked car.\nVisitors should limit their interactions with others in the facility.\nVisitors should wash and/or use hand sanitizer frequently.\nPatients in critical care fall under a special visitation category, and\n				 will be determined on a case by cases basis.\n\n\nHospital entry points will be limited to enable screening of visitors.\n		 Visitors who show any signs of illness, including mild symptoms, should\n		 not visit patients in the hospital or accompany patients to the emergency\n		 department.\nAll patients and visitors must wear a mask at all times.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about the Novel Coronavirus\nWhat is our hospital doing to protect patients?\n\nWe are screening patients with symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of\n		 breath and with a history of travel within the past 14 days to communities\n		 with widespread or sustained community transmission of the coronavirus.\nIf we have a confirmed or potential patient with COVID-19, we will institute\n		 standard infectious disease protocols, as well as additional measures,\n		 to prevent the potential spread of the virus. All healthcare providers\n		 who have contact with the patient will use appropriate personal protective\n		 equipment (PPE), following U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n		 (CDC) guidelines.\n\nHow concerned should I be about the coronavirus?\n\nAs of now, the seasonal flu remains a significant health risk.\nCoronaviruses can cause the common cold and pneumonia. Most people infected\n		 with the novel coronavirus have mild cold symptoms. A small fraction of\n		 people, however, may require more intensive care. We understand your concern\n		 about protecting yourself from respiratory diseases.\nWe have launched an online self-checker for the novel coronavirus in the\n		 form of a bot nicknamed Robby. Robby walks users through symptoms and\n		 then gives recommendations if medical care is needed. Robby is not intended\n		 to be used for diagnosis or treatment purposes. Click the blue \"Start\n		 Self-Check Assessment\" button to launch the self-checker:\n\n		Keep informed of the risk by checking the\n		situation update on the CDC website.\n	\n\nWhat can I do to protect myself?\nIt is understandable to feel uncertain or anxious during a public health\n	 crisis, and we need to remember to avoid making assumptions about others\n	 perceived symptoms or any characteristics of identity. Currently, there\n	 is no vaccine to prevent the novel coronavirus infection. The best way\n	 to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus.\n\n	Here are the current\n	CDC recommendations to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses:\n\n\nTake everyday preventive actions for respiratory infections, such as avoiding\n		 close contact with people who are sick, staying home when sick, and washing\n		 hands often.\n\n		Avoid traveling to places with widespread or sustained community transmission\n		 of the coronavirus. A good place for reliable travel information can be\n		 found on the\n		CDCs travel advisory page.\n	\n\nShould I wear a mask?\nDue to Dallas County requirements, all patients and visitors must wear\n	 a mask at all times.\nWhere can I learn more?\n\n	Concerned patients and family members should talk with their healthcare provider.\n\nYou can also find more information about the virus from these websites.\n\n\nCDC/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Parkland is vaccinating established 1B patients. Signing up for MyChart in order to get the vaccine with no history of care at Parkland will not qualify someone as a Parkland patient. Parkland also provides vaccines for some individuals who signed up through the Dallas County Health and Human Services website at Dallas County COVID-19 vaccine. That list is sent to us from the county and we will contact the people on our list proactively. The general public (non-Parkland patients) cannot bypass the county’s sign up process and schedule an appointment directly with Parkland. Any person trying to schedule a vaccine with Parkland MUST have been first contacted by Parkland with instructions. We will not honor appointments that do not follow this process. If other organizations or individuals tell you to sign up for a vaccination at Parkland and we have not contacted you, the appointment will not be honored. ONLY direct contact from Parkland with instructions can ensure you get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine. If you wish to sign up on the Dallas County Health and Human Services website, please visit Dallas County COVID-19 vaccine. For additional information, please visit Texas Department of State Health Services.\nWho is currently able to get the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine is being given to people in phases, based on the guidelines by the Texas Department of State Health Services. Healthcare workers and people who live in long-term care facilities were the first group (Phase 1A) of people to get the vaccine.\n\nPeople in the second group, Phase 1B, are now able to get a COVID-19 vaccine. You may get the vaccine in Phase 1B if you are in one of the following groups:\n\n\nPeople who are 65 years or older\nPeople who are at least 16 years and have at least one chronic medical condition that makes you more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19, including:\n    \nCancer\nChronic kidney disease\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\nCertain heart problems\nSolid organ transplant\nObesity and severe obesity\nPregnancy\nSickle cell disease\nType 2 diabetes mellitus, among others\n\n\n\nGet the most current information about who can get the vaccine from the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\n\n\n\nI am a Parkland patient in Group 1B – how do I get the vaccine?\n\nWe are contacting our 1B patients through MyChart accounts.

Pfizer’s trials included 43,000 people and Moderna’s had 30,000 (most vaccine trials use 20,000 – 30,000). The safety data indicated that serious adverse reactions were very uncommon and were not higher than expected among the general population. In addition, no specific safety concerns were found based on age, race, ethnicity, medical comorbidities (additional medical conditions) or prior COVID-19 infection. Side effects from the vaccine may include feeling tired, headache, chills, muscle pain or joint pain. For most people these went away after 1-2 days.\n\nParkland experts believe the steps taken by the FDA and the CDC to approve these vaccines will keep people safe.\n\nLearn more about the different vaccines from the CDC.\n\n\n\nShould I get the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThere is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you are not at risk of severe complications. If you get COVID-19, you also may spread the disease to friends, family and loved ones, even if you dont feel sick. The more people who get the vaccination, the more we can protect our loved ones and the quicker we can get back to a more normal life including visiting family and friends, attending worship services, going to restaurants and other activities.\n\nIf you are not sure the vaccine is right for you or have questions, talk with your trusted healthcare provider about getting the vaccine.\n\n\n\nMore information about the COVID-19 vaccines\nLearn more about the COVID-19 vaccine, who can get it, how it works and its safety.\n\n\nJust like the COVID-19 virus, myths about the COVID-19 vaccine’s safety and effectiveness are spreading.

The amount of vaccine available to us has been limited to one hundred doses per week and the current priority is to provide these individuals with the two vaccinations needed to be fully immunized. We are doing everything possible in conjunction with the major pharmacy companies in the area to best procure the currently limited supply of vaccine while using what is available to best slow the spread to others.\nIn order to prepare for the next priority group for vaccination designated 1B, which will begin January 18th, our staff have been reaching out to schools, senior citizens, first responders, postal service workers, manufacturing plant and daycare workers to identify those who wish to receive the vaccine. The response from our senior citizens has been great and we are currently experiencing a large number of phone calls to be placed on a list for vaccination. These calls are being returned in the order of which they are received and an assessment completed which would identify age and underlying health issues that assist in prioritizing those in greatest need.\nWe have every reason to believe that the weekly shipment of vaccine will increase substantially over the course of time as they must if significant numbers of Clark County residents can be protected in a timely manner. In the meantime the best plan for our communities is the continued use of all precautions which can slow the spread. Wear a mask in public to protect those around you as well as yourself. Respect the space of others around you as they may well be more vulnerable and this especially applies to our senior citizens whose value to the community cannot be overstated. A child missing a loved one is not interested in politics so we should all try to suppress ours when making decisions affecting others. That same child may be wearing a mask all day in school and might be encouraged by adults taking similar measures. Be assured that your Clark County Health Department is working harder than ever to help all of our lives return to normal as soon as possible and ask that you help where you can showing patience with our efforts to include all those who want a chance to receive this vaccine.\nShare this:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) \nJanuary 15, 2021\nNo Comments\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nPost navigation\n← Options to Reduce Contact Quarantine Times Board Of Health Meeting February 8, 2021 →','No content','62442','997 N YORK ST MARTINSVILLE 62442',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:45:06','2021-02-27 08:48:06','CLARK COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT','IL','div|container content-area'),(195,46,'https://www.afcurgentcare.com/englewood/patient-resources/covid-testing/','No content','No content','80110','901 W Hampden Ave Ste 103 Englewood, CO',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:47:34','2021-02-27 08:47:34','AFC Urgent Care Englewood','WA','div|SubBanner'),(196,12,'http://clintoncountyhealth.com/','No content','No content','62231','930 FAIRFAX ST,STE A CARLYLE 62231',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:49:56','2021-02-27 08:50:56','CLINTON COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT','IL','div|home page page-id-6 page-parent page-template-default no-slider'),(197,46,'https://www.nationaljewish.org/patients-visitors/patient-info/important-updates/coronavirus-information-and-resources/covid-19-vaccines','HomePatients & VisitorsPatient InformationImportant UpdatesCoronavirus: Information & ResourcesCOVID-19 Vaccines \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus: Information & Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView by:\n\n\n\nOverview\nCOVID-19 Testing\nCOVID-19 Vaccines\nPatient Care for COVID-19\nPrevention & Tips\nAbout Coronavirus\nNews & Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               \r\n\nVaccine Appointments\r\n	Not Currently Available\nTesting Appointments\nPatient Care\nDonate to COVID-19 Fund\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronavirus: Information & Resources\n\n\n\nCoronavirus: Information & Resources\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Testing\n\n\n\nSchedule Self-Referral Testing\n\n\n\nTesting Info & Resources\n\n\nCOVID-19 Test Results Guide\n\nThe Difference Between Tests for COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 Molecular Diagnostic Test (Swab Test)\n\nCOVID-19 Antibody Test (Blood Draw)\n\nCOVID-19 Testing FAQs\n\nDownload Test Facts\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Testing: Physician Referrals\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Testing: For Businesses\n\n\nCOVID-19 Testing for Business Form\n\nReturn-to-Work Services for Businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccines\n\n\n\nVaccine Articles\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Development\n\nHow Do Two-Dose Vaccines Work?\n\n7 Things to Know Post-Vaccine\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Eligibility\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Information\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine FAQs\n\n\n\nProof of COVID-19 Vaccination\n\n\n\nTypes of Vaccines\n\n\n\nVaccine Locations & Maps\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient Care for COVID-19\n\n\n\nPatient & Visitor Information\n\n\nTelehealth Appointments\n\n\n\n\nAcute Respiratory Clinic\n\n\n\nRespiratory Recovery Clinic\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & Kids\n\n\n\nInfusion Center for COVID-19 Care\n\n\nPatient Treatment Information for Infusion Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention & Tips\n\n\n\nAbout COVID-19\n\n\nBack to School with Asthma & COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & Altitude\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & Cystic Fibrosis\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus): Who Are the Carriers?\n\nAllergies, Cold, Flu or COVID-19 Virus?\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & Allergies\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & Asthma\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & Cancer\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & COPD\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & Diabetes\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & Lupus\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) & Your Lungs\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) More Severe for Smokers & Vapers\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) Printable Materials\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) Who Should Get Tested?\n\nCOVID-19 and Your Heart\n\nMasks Protect Against Infection\n\nPotential Medications for COVID-19\n\nYoung People Can Get COVID-19 (Coronavirus)\n\nYour Mental Health and COVID-19\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Tips\n\n\n10 Tips for Safe Winter Fun with COVID-19\n\nCelebrating Holidays During COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus): Hand Washing\n\nGoing to the Doctor During COVID-19\n\nHand Sanitizer FAQs\n\nHelping Patients Improve After COVID-19\n\nHousehold Cleaning and Disinfecting for COVID-19 (Coronavirus)\n\nHow National Jewish Health Expanded Diagnostic Testing for COVID-19\n\nHow Social Distancing Will Flatten the Curve\n\nHow Social Gatherings Spread COVID-19 – and How to Reduce Your Risk\n\nHow to Avoid the Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n\nHow to Disinfect to Kill Germs\n\nQuarantining with Kids during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Crisis\n\nReturning to School During COVID-19\n\nSocial Distancing, Self-Isolation and Self-Quarantine\n\nStay Away!

The goal with a vaccine is to help the body prepare for an actual infection, so it is ready to rapidly and effectively eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus when exposed to it.\nThere are different types of vaccines. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are called messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA in the vaccines carry genetic instructions which cells in the body use to make copies of viral proteins. Once your cells make those proteins, your immune system will make the antibodies that bind to the protein, disable the virus, and protect you from getting sick or as sick from this virus.\nHow do we know that the vaccine is safe and effective?The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews all vaccines for safety before allowing them to be administered to the public. Additionally, The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), also assesses the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.\nClinical trials of the vaccines lead to an understanding of safety and effectiveness. With the two early vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, preliminary data suggests they are both about 95% effective. That means that under controlled conditions there were about 95 percent fewer cases of COVID-19 in the group of people who got the vaccine compared to the group of people who got the placebo.\nHow soon will someone be protected after taking the vaccine?With the two mRNA vaccines, it is estimated that immunity develops around two to three weeks after completing the second shot in the series, but each vaccine works a little differently and every individual responds a little differently.\nBoth the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are a two shot series, and it is important that an individual have both shots in order to confer immunity. \nHow many shots will I need to get?Most of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. require two (2) consecutive shots, three or four weeks apart, for the vaccine series. Future COVID-19 vaccines may require only one shot. Currently, Pfizer’s vaccine requires two doses in the vaccine series to be given three weeks apart.\nCan I get the vaccine if I am not feeling well?If you are in a group that is currently eligible to receive the vaccine and you are not feeling well, it is recommended that you wait until you are feeling better to get the vaccine. If you have symptoms and/or signs of respiratory infection, evaluation and testing from health care resources in your community is recommended.\nView all COVID-19 Vaccine FAQs\n \n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus) Patient Education Materials\nLearn more about COVID-19 and how it affects specific health conditions in these printable patient education materials.\nDownload COVID-19 Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on COVID-19 (Coronavirus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n COVID-19 Vaccine FAQs \n \n\n\n Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Hand Sanitizer FAQs \n \n\n\n Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Helping Patients Improve After COVID-19 \n \n\n\n Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n The Difference Between Tests for COVID-19 \n \n\n\n Read More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView More','No content','80206','1400 Jackson St Denver, CO',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:50:34','2021-02-27 08:50:34','National Jewish Health','WA','div|main-wrap'),(198,12,'https://book-costcopharmacy.appointment-plus.com/cttb5n42/?e_id=5435#/','','No content','60614','2754 N Clybourn Ave Chicago, IL  60614',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:52:44','2021-02-27 08:54:58','Costco Pharmacy','IL','div|logout_feedback modal'),(199,31,'https://www.bronxcare.org/about-us/covid-19-testing/','No content','No content','10456','1276 Fulton Ave Bronx, NY',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:53:13','2021-02-27 08:53:13','Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center','NY','div|page-wrap'),(200,46,'https://www.sclhealth.org/locations/good-samaritan-medical-center/covidvaccine/','Temporary Visitor Restrictions\nOverview of COVID-19\nIf Youre Experiencing Symptoms\nCOVID-19 Screening at Our Facilities\nCOVID-19 Testing\nCOVID-19 Vaccine\nDonate Blood in Colorado\nSupply Donation Information','No content','80026','200 Exempla Cir Lafayette, CO',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:54:54','2021-02-27 08:54:54','Good Samaritan Medical Center','WA','div|right-column'),(201,12,'http://www.cchd.net/','No content','No content','62454','202 N CHRISTOPHER BLVD 	ROBINSON 62454',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:56:11','2021-02-27 08:57:03','CRAWFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT','IL','div|inner-section'),(202,46,'https://onpointurgentcare.com/covid19-information/','','No content','80016','24300 E Smoky Hill Rd Ste 120 Aurora, CO',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:58:20','2021-02-27 08:58:20','OnPoint Urgent Care','WA','div|fusion-boxed-shadow'),(203,12,'https://cumberlandhealth.org/','Vaccinations are beginning\nDue to the limited number of vaccines that we are receiving, you must have an appointment to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at this time. \n\n\nDownload the COVID-19 vaccination form\n\n\nForms are only valid for those with a scheduled appointment. \nPlease print and complete the screening form and complete the top box of the permission form and bring with you the day of your appointment. \nIf you do not have a printer, forms will be available at your appointment. \nIf you have questions about completing the form, we will have staff available to help you complete your form during your appointment.\n OFFICE HOURS\n\n\n\nMonday – Thursday\n8:00 – 5:00\n\n\n\n\n (217) 849-3211','No content','62468','https://cumberlandhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/COVID-19-vaccination-form.pdf\n200 S INDIANA ST TOLEDO 62468',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 08:58:30','2021-02-27 08:59:03','CUMBERLAND COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT','IL','div|fusion-builder-row fusion-row'),(204,12,'https://health.dekalbcounty.org/about/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccination/','HomeAboutCoronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Planning in DeKalb County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Notification SystemClick on a button below to fill out the vaccine notification form as an individual or for a business/agency/organization.

Second dose clinics originally scheduled to be held on February 18th and 19th were moved to this week on February 25th and 26th.     As of end of day on Thursday, February 25, 2021, DCHD has administered over 7,300 (1st and 2nd dose) COVID-19 vaccines to Phase 1a Healthcare Workers and individuals in Phase 1b including First Responders, individuals in the K-12 Education Sector, Childcare Providers, Public Transit Workers and those 65 and older. Since the week of December 21, 2020, we have allocated a total of 3,300 (1st and 2nd dose) vaccines to NM Kishwaukee and Valley West Hospitals for the vaccination of Healthcare workers and those patients 65 years and older. We have also recently partnered with Greater Elgin Center for Family Health to provide an initial allocation of 200 doses to be administered to their patients who fall in Phase 1a or 1b.  With the recent decrease in first dose vaccine availability, we are continuing to pause all re-allocation of vaccine until vaccine allotment increases.  Until vaccine supply increases, DeKalb County will not be expanding to the Phase 1b Plus group announced by the Governor that includes individuals ages 16–64 years with co-morbidities and underlying conditions, as well as individuals with disabilities. Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for transitioning between phases, we will look to move in to the Phase 1b Plus group when supply increases significantly through more doses available of current vaccines or new vaccine authorized, when most persons within current Phase 1b are vaccinated or when demand in the current phase is less than vaccine available.The Health Department does not currently allocate vaccine to local pharmacy providers. Vaccine supply for pharmacies is directly allocated by either the federal Government or the state. Although the state is actively adding pharmacy partners as vaccine locations, there are still limitations as it relates to appointment availability. Information on local vaccine providers can be accessed by using the following link: https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/vaccination-locationWe continue to encourage those who work or live in DeKalb County to log on to the Health Department’s website to register to receive notification of vaccine availability.  There is no need to register more than once in the system.  Registering multiple times will not move you ahead on the list.  It is important for residents to know, that even though they are eligible in Phase 1b, it will take time before they are notified of their eligibility to register for an appointment. There is no need to verify your registration into the notification system.We continue to advise the community that second dose vaccine appointments should be made at the same location the first dose was received.  Each vaccine provider receives specific second dose allocations based on the number of first doses they are allocated.  If you go to an alternate provider location for the second dose it may mean that you are taking away an allotted second dose from someone else at the other location. Individuals who receive 1st dose from DCHD will receive and email to schedule your second dose within a week of when your second dose is due.Due to the size of Phase 1b and the current allocation, we ask that everyone be patient. Everyone in Phase 1b will not receive an appointment registration link at the same time. Registration is sent out to individuals on the vaccine notification list based on our current allocation for that week.**Please understand that with winter storms, safety is our number one concern and it may be likely in the winter months that a COVID-19 appointment may be cancelled if a storm is projected. Please know that when this happens, we will reschedule your appointment. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding as we want all who are driving to our clinics to be safe.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine SafetyCOVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, and these vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. This monitoring includes using both established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that COVID-19 vaccines are safe.Results from these monitoring efforts are reassuring. While some people don’t have any side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, many people will have mild side effects after COVID-19 vaccination, like pain or swelling at the injection site, a headache, chills, or fever. These reactions are normal and show the vaccine is working. A small number of people have had a severe allergic reaction (called “anaphylaxis”) after vaccination, but this is extremely rare and when it does happen, vaccination providers have medicines available that they can use to effectively and immediately treat the reaction. You will be asked to stay for 15–30 minutes after you get your vaccine so you can be observed and provided treatment in the rare case it is needed.The combination of COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations to protect yourself and others offers the best protection from COVID-19. CDC recommends you get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you are eligible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccination AppointmentOnce you have an appointment scheduled with us to receive your COVID-19 vaccine, you will need to print the following form filled out to both your 1st dose and 2nd dose appointments.COVID-19 Client Administration Form_EnglishCOVID-19 Client Administration Form_Spanish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResourcesInformation on the Moderna COVID-19 VaccineCDC-Information about the Moderna COVID-19 VaccineIllinois Department of Public Health: Information on the COVID-19 VaccineCOVID-19 FAQsRegion 1 COVID-19 Vaccine FAQV-Safe After Vaccination Health CheckerIDPH Vaccination Site Locator','No content','60115','2550 N ANNIE GLIDDEN RD DEKALB 60115',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 09:00:09','2021-02-27 09:00:52','DEKALB COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT','IL','div|small-12 medium-9 columns main-content-container'),(205,12,'https://www.dewittpiatthealth.com/','Welcome!\n\nWelcomeFebruary 28, 2021\nFriends:\n \nIn an effort to be especially transparent, I’m sharing with you our concerns over additional shipments of vaccine.  We currently only have enough vaccine to provide for our clinics scheduled Monday and Tuesday this week (2/22/2021).  We were expecting a shipment of doses through the Illinois Department of Public Health last week, but due to the winter storm, that shipment was delayed and is expected now this week.  I have been told it will arrive “before Tuesday,” but we are relying very heavily now on its receipt to be able to continue. \n \nAt our current pace, we are vaccinating around 1650 per week.  This week’s scheduled delivery was 200 doses, and next week’s scheduled delivery is 300 doses.  We will be unable to maintain our current pace. As such, we will not be able to load any additional SignUpGenius links for new appointment slots until more vaccine becomes available.\n \nWe are imploring now upon your compassion, if you have scheduled a FIRST DOSE appointment and are not considered vulnerable AND age 65 or older, please consider canceling your appointment this week.  Wait for more SignUpGeniuses to come soon and re-schedule your appointment at that time.  Please email us of your cancellation so we can change our appointment schedule.\n \nOur priority now will be appointments for SECOND DOSES only.

Ensure vaccination locations can reach populations, manage cold-chain requirements and meet reporting requirements for vaccine supply and uptake. Vaccine administration strategies in Phase 1 are divided into three sub-phases:\n\nPhase 1a\n\nHealthcare Personnel\nLong-term care facility residents and staff\nPhase 1A Chart per IDPH\n\n\n\n• Phase 1b\n\nPhase 1B Chart per IDPH\n\no Persons aged 65 years and older\no Frontline essential workers, defined as those workers who are essential for the\nfunctioning of society and are at highest risk of exposure, including the following:\nFirst responders: Firefighters (including volunteers), Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs), 911 Dispatch (Public Safety Answering Point – PSAP), Security Personnel, School Officers. (EMS personnel are considered under Phase 1a).\nCorrections Officers/Inmates: Jail Officers, Juvenile Facility Staff, Workers Providing In-Person Support, Inmates.\nFood and Agriculture Workers: Processing, Plants, Veterinary Health, Livestock Services, Animal Care.\nPostal Service Workers\nManufacturing Workers: Industrial production of goods for distribution to retail wholesale or other manufacturers.\nGrocery Store Workers: Baggers, Cashiers, Stockers, Pick-Up, Customer Service.\nPublic Transit Workers: Flight Crew, Bus Drivers, Train Conductors, Taxi Drivers, Para-Transit Drivers, In-Person Support, Ride Sharing Services.\nEducation (Congregate Child Care, Pre-K through 12th grade): Teachers, Principals, Student Support, Student Aids, Day Care Workers.\nShelters/Adult Day Care: Homeless Shelter, Women’s Shelter, Adult Day/Drop-In Program, Sheltered Workshop, Psycho-Social Rehab.\n• Phase 1c: (Is still in draft form based on ACIP recommendations.

Conditions include obesity, diabetes, pulmonary disease, heart condition including hypertension, kidney disease, cancer, immunocompromised, sickle cell and pregnancy.\n(Note: As of the date of this plan, only Pfizer has been authorized for those under 18, from the age’s 16 & up, whereas Moderna is 18 & up)\no Other essential workers, may include:\nTransportation & Logistics\nFood Service\nHousing (e.g., Construction)\nFinance (e.g., bank tellers)\nInformation Technology & Communication\nEnergy\nMedia\nLegal\nPublic Safety (e.g., Safety Engineers)\nWater & Wastewater\nPublic Health Workers\n• Phase 2: (more guidance to come pending ACIP recommendations):\no It is possible that Phase 2 will include the rest of the population aged 16 or aged 18 & up.\no ACIP will make specific age recommendations as data become available.\n\n\n\n1. The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is a top priority.\na. The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how federal partners are working together to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.\n2. Many vaccines are being developed and tested, but some might be ready before others—CDC is planning for many possibilities.\na. CDC is working with partners at all levels, including healthcare associations, on flexible COVID-19 vaccination programs that can accommodate different vaccines and scenarios. CDC has been in contact with your state public health department to help with your state’s planning. State, tribal, local, and territorial health departments are critical to making sure vaccines are available to communities.\n3. At least at first, COVID-19 vaccines might be used under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n4. There may be a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines before the end of 2020, but supply will continually increase in the weeks and months that follow.\na. The goal is for everyone to be able to easily get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as large quantities are available. The plan is to have several thousand vaccination providers available, including doctors’ offices, retail pharmacies, hospitals, and federally qualified health centers.\n5. If there is limited supply, some groups may be recommended to get a COVID-19 vaccine first.\na. Experts are working on how to distribute these limited vaccines in a fair, ethical, and transparent way.\n6. At first, COVID-19 vaccines may not be recommended for children.\na. In early clinical trials for various COVID-19 vaccines, only non-pregnant adults participated. However, clinical trials continue to expand those recruited to participate. The groups recommended to receive the vaccines could change in the future.\n7. Cost will not be an obstacle to getting vaccinated against COVID-19.\na. Vaccine doses purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost. However, vaccine providers will be able to charge administration fees for giving or administering the shot to someone. Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patient’s public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund.\n8.

As we move to Phase 1B, we will use the vaccines we are allocated to vaccinate at-risk frontline workers in our primary service area and targeted groups of high-risk patients who are age 65 and older. \n\n\nUnfortunately, the demand for COVID-19 vaccine is much greater than the supply, and we do not have any first-dose COVID-19 vaccine, at this time. We will update the website as soon as we once again have available first-dose appointments. \n\n\nVaccine distribution Q&A\n\nWhen can I get the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine is currently in limited supply and is being distributed in phases by local health departments. Phase 1A includes healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities. Phase 1B focuses on people age 65 and older and other essential workers.\nAs we move to Phase 1B, we will begin offering the vaccine to our highest risk patients first. If you use a physician of Edward-Elmhurst Medical Groups for your primary or specialty care, rest assured that we have your information regarding your age and any possible risk factors, and we will reach out as soon as we have a vaccine available for you. If you aren’t a patient or have not seen a physician in quite some time, we encourage you to seek out another option for getting vaccinated.\nIt is likely that giving vaccines to the numbers of people who need one will take some time — probably well into the spring 2021. As the supply of vaccine increases, we will move to subsequent phases and can begin to vaccinate anyone age 64 and under.\n\nHow will I know when its my turn to receive the vaccine?\n\nWe are committed to vaccinating as many people as we can, as quickly as we can. We have a distribution plan in place and if you are a high-risk patient over age 65, we will reach out to you as we obtain vaccine supply. Beginning with patients who are at highest risk, you will receive an order allowing you to schedule a vaccine appointment.  \n\nIf you have a MyChart® account – Watch for an email letting you know that you have a new order in your MyChart. Log in to your MyChart, and you’ll be able to schedule an appointment. \n\nIf you do not have a MyChart account – Watch for an email asking you to activate your MyChart account. The email will include an activation link so that you can complete this step. \n\nRest assured, if you are a patient of Edward-Elmhurst Medical Groups, we have your information regarding your age and any possible risk factors, and we will notify you as soon as we have a vaccine available for you. Vaccinating the numbers of people who qualify will take some time. It could take several weeks or longer to hear from us, but please know that we will reach out to you.\n\nShould I call my doctors office to let them know I want the vaccine?\n\nWe recognize and respect that you are anxious to receive a vaccine. We do ask, however, that you avoid calling physician offices with availability questions, as our offices are not coordinating appointments or wait lists. While we are eager to help, the number of incoming telephone calls are becoming difficult for us to manage, and calling your doctor’s office will not help you receive the vaccine any faster. We will reach out to you as soon as we have a vaccine available for you.\n\nWho is considered a patient of Edward-Elmhurst Medical Groups?\n\nEdward-Elmhurst Medical Groups include physicians of the following practices:\n\nEdward Medical Group\n    \nElmhurst Clinic  \nElmhurst Medical Associates  \nElmhurst Memorial Medical Group\n\nIf you use a physician from one of these practices for your primary or specialty care, and had a visit in the last three years, you are on the list of patients eligible for a vaccine.\n\nWhat if I am age 65+, but have never seen a physician with Edward-Elmhurst Medical Groups?\n\n The number of vaccine doses for phase 1B remains limited. Distribution of the vaccine at Edward-Elmhurst Health will begin with patients in our established physician practice who are age 65 and older, as well as other essential workers in our primary service area. If you are over the age of 65, but have never seen one of the physician practices within Edward-Elmhurst Medical Groups, our recommendation is to seek a vaccination from your local health department or a retail pharmacy such as CVS or Walgreens.\n\nWhere will I get the vaccine when its my turn?\n\n We do not yet have enough vaccine supply to deliver vaccinations at your doctor’s office. Vaccines will be given at one of two Edward-Elmhurst Health locations by appointment only:\n\n\nEdward-Elmhurst Health – Downers Grove\n    2205 Butterfield Rd\n    \n    Downers Grove, IL 60515\n\n\nEdward-Elmhurst Health & Fitness Center – Seven Bridges\n    \n    6600 S. Route 53\n    \n    Woodridge, IL 60517\n\n\nIf Im not a patient, how can I get the vaccine?\n\n We are currently vaccinating targeted groups of high-risk patients who are in phase 1B of our vaccine distribution plan. If you aren’t a patient or have not seen a physician in quite some time, we encourage you to seek out another option for getting vaccinated.\n In addition to the efforts of Edward-Elmhurst Health, vaccinations may be available through your local pharmacy or health department. As supplies increase, the vaccine will likely become more widely available to the general public later in 2021.\n Some county health departments are offering information and surveys to receive weekly updates on vaccine availability:\n\nWill County\nDuPage County\nKane County\nKendall County\n\nPharmacies:\n\nCVS\nWalgreens\nMeijer\n\n\nCan I choose which vaccine to get?\n\nNot currently. Which vaccine you receive depends on supply and where you decide to get it. As long as the vaccines remain in short supply, our hospitals are administering whichever vaccine is available to us. Rest assured, measures of the safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines seem roughly comparable. Both vaccines were 94-95 percent effective in preventing symptomatic coronavirus infection, and nearly 100 percent effective in preventing severe illness from COVID-19. Most experts agree that what matters most right now is getting vaccinated.\n\nWhat are the phases of COVID-19 vaccine distribution?\n\nThe following are phases of our COVID-19 vaccine distribution, guided by the CDC and state and local public health departments and based on risk prioritization and vaccine supply:\nPhase 1A \n\nHealthcare workers\nLong-term care facility residents \n\nPhase 1B – current phase\n\nOther at-risk essential workers (e.g., police/fire departments, teachers)\nPeople age 65+\n    \n\nPhase 1C \n\nPeople missed in Phase 1A and Phase 1B\nOther essential workers\nOther people with certain high-risk health conditions\n\nPhase 2 \n\nPeople missed in phase 1\nOther people with chronic health conditions\nGeneral public\n\nPhase 3 \n\nPeople missed in phases 1 and 2\nGeneral public\n\n\nIs there anything I should do to prepare for my vaccine appointment?\n\n\nIn order to minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure to our patients, providers and staff, we are asking that you come alone to your vaccine appointment. If you need the support of a partner due to limited mobility, cognitive impairment or language barriers, an exception may be made. We are unable to allow children to accompany you. Please arrange for childcare prior to your appointment.\nPlease wear comfortable clothing with a short sleeve in order to allow easy access to your upper arm. \nYou can expect to spend approximately 30 minutes at the vaccination site. Part of this time will be spent making sure you don’t have any medical symptoms.\nIf you begin to experience any symptoms of COVID-19 prior to your vaccination appointment, it is important that you cancel your appointment.\nAdditionally, you should not get a vaccine for COVID-19 if you have or plan to receive another vaccine of any kind within 14 days of the COVID-19 vaccine or if you have received plasma or monoclonal antibodies in the past 90 days. If either of these apply, please cancel your vaccination appointment. \nYou will be asked to complete a vaccine consent form prior to receiving your vaccine. You can fill out your form in advance to save some time. Bring it with you to the appointment.\n    \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Consent Form\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Consent Form – Spanish version\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Consent Form for Employees of Edward-Elmhurst Health\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Consent Form for Employees of Edward-Elmhurst Health – Spanish version\n\n\nYou will be asked to make an appointment for your second dose of vaccine at the time of your first appointment.\n\n21 days later for Pfizer vaccines\n28 days later for Moderna vaccines\n\n\n\nI’m a frontline worker and my doctor is a part of Edward-Elmhurst Medical Groups. How do I get a vaccine?\n\nIf you have a MyChart, you should see a \"Confirm Your Occupation\" notice on the MyChart home page. You can follow the link to complete an occupation questionnaire. If you don’t see the notice on your home page, go to \"Questionnaires\" from the MyChart menu and select the \"Occupation\" questionnaire from the menu. This information will be used to send you an invitation to schedule an appointment as we have vaccine supply. If you do not have a MyChart, call your physician’s office and ask for an activation link.\n\nIs it true there are actually scams related to the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nUnfortunately, yes. And we have seen evidence of this type of thing in our area. Be aware of any requests asking you to pay in advance or pay out-of-pocket for a vaccine. Edward-Elmhurst Health will not ask for any advance payment. You can go here for more information about vaccine fraud.\n\nVaccine Q&A\n\nWhat COVID-19 vaccines been approved?\n\nIn December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for two COVID-19 vaccines, one manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech (age 16 and up) and another by Moderna (age 18 and up). EUA is an authorization process used by the FDA if there is an emergency and enough evidence that the vaccine will be safe and helpful. Vaccines authorized for EUA still need to meet the FDAs rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. Several other vaccines are also in development.\n\nHow does the COVID-19 vaccine work? \n\nVaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. The COVID-19 vaccine helps your body develop proteins called antibodies that make you less susceptible to the disease. \nThe Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna mRNA 1273 are mRNA vaccines. They contain the portion of mRNA that encodes the spike protein, the button on the surface of the SARS-CoV2 virus. It is not a live virus, cannot replicate itself and is quickly destroyed in the cell shortly after translation. Once the spike protein is translated by the mRNA, an immune response is elicited, resulting in production of antibodies against the spike protein. When the SARS-CoV2 spike protein is bound up by antibodies, it cannot attach to and infect human cells.\n\nIs the COVID-19 vaccine is safe? \n\nYes, COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. are authorized after meeting rigorous scientific standards for safety. The first authorized COVID-19 vaccine, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, was studied in more than 40,000 people, to ensure they meet safety standards. The FDA will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of authorized vaccines through ongoing clinical trials and vaccination data.\n\nWill the vaccine require more than one dose? \n\nFor the most recently available vaccines, yes. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require two shots. The interval between shots for the Pfizer vaccine is 21 days and for the Moderna vaccine, its 28 days. \nThe first shot starts building protection and the second shot strengthens the immune response. Both doses are necessary in order to ensure the vaccine’s effectiveness. The vaccines are not interchangeable, so individuals should complete the second dose with the same vaccine.\n\nWhat’s the difference between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines?\n\nCurrently, two vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are authorized and recommended to prevent COVID-19. At this point, one COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended over the other as both show similar efficacy. \nOne difference is in how the vaccines are stored. While both vaccines need to be kept cold, the Moderna vaccine must be stored at a temperature of a regular refrigerator freezer and can be used within 30 days after thawing, while the Pfizer vaccine requires special ultra-cold freezers and must be used with five days after thawing.\n\nWill the vaccine cause side effects? \n\nAs with other vaccines, it is normal to experience some pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, or low-grade fever following the vaccination, which should go away on their own in a day or two. This does not mean that the vaccine has given you COVID-19. These symptoms are typical reactions to most vaccines and are a sign that your immune system is doing exactly what it is supposed to do — building up protection to the disease.\n\nWill the vaccine give me the virus?\n\nNo. The vaccines contain a portion of mRNA, but not live virus. After the spike protein is produced, the mRNA is degraded. A normal immune response can lead to low grade fever or achiness, but this is not harmful. The full benefit of immunity won’t occur until a couple weeks after your second dose (booster dose). The risk of getting infected from someone who is infectious won’t diminish right away after vaccination.\n\nAre there any contraindications to the vaccine?\n\nAccording to the CDC, while rare, anaphylactic reactions have been reported following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Individuals with a history of an immediate allergic reaction (of any severity) to an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components might be at greater risk for anaphylaxis upon re-exposure to either mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. \nThese individuals should be evaluated by an allergist-immunologist to determine if they can safely receive the vaccine. Individuals with a history of an immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a vaccine or injectable therapy, and individuals with a history of anaphylaxis due to any cause, should be observed for 30 minutes following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. All other individuals should be observed for 15 minutes. Allergic reactions not related to vaccines, such as food or environmental allergies, are not a contraindication or precaution to vaccination with either mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nI’ve heard that you shouldn’t get the COVID-19 vaccine if you’ve recently had a vaccination of a different type — flu, shingles, etc. Is this true?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that you wait at least 14 days before getting any other vaccine, including a flu or shingles vaccine, if you get your COVID-19 vaccine first. And if you get another vaccine first, wait at least 14 days before getting your COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nWhen should I schedule my screening mammogram and COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nA possible side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine is temporarily swollen lymph nodes on the side where the shot is given, which may show up on a mammogram and result in unnecessary diagnostic follow-up. \nIf you are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, it is recommended that you schedule your screening mammogram before getting your first COVID-19 vaccine dose, or four weeks following your second vaccine dose. This does not apply to mammograms for symptomatic patients or to diagnostic mammograms, which should not be delayed. As always, talk with your healthcare provider about what is best for you. If you’ve had the COVID-19 vaccine and are already scheduled for a screening mammogram, let your technologist know that you were vaccinated and in which arm you got your shot. \n\nHow long will it take after I get the vaccine to be protected from COVID-19?\n\nThose who receive the two-dose vaccine will develop maximum immunity several weeks after the second dose. It normally takes about 2-3 weeks for cellular immunity to develop and several weeks for full antibody development.\n\nOnce I’ve had a vaccine, can I stop wearing masks?\n\nNo, you should continue to wear a mask after receiving the vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were around 95% effective in trials for preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19. We don’t, however, know the vaccine’s effect on asymptomatic infection or transmission of the virus. It will be several months before the overall risk of exposure is low because so many others have been immunized. Until most of the population is vaccinated, wearing masks, distancing and handwashing are the only tools we have to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nHow can I protect myself from getting COVID-19 until I get the vaccine?\n\nThe best defense against COVID-19 is to continue following safety precautions. Cover your mouth and nose with a face mask when around others, avoid close contact with people who are sick, stay at least 6 feet away from people outside of your household, avoid crowds and wash your hands often and thoroughly.

It is not a live virus, cannot replicate itself and is quickly destroyed in the cell shortly after translation. Once the spike protein is translated by the mRNA, an immune response is elicited, resulting in production of antibodies against the spike protein. When the SARS-CoV2 spike protein is bound up by antibodies, it cannot attach to and infect human cells.\n\nIs the COVID-19 vaccine is safe? \n\nYes, COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. are authorized after meeting rigorous scientific standards for safety. The first authorized COVID-19 vaccine, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, was studied in more than 40,000 people, to ensure they meet safety standards. The FDA will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of authorized vaccines through ongoing clinical trials and vaccination data.\n\nWill the vaccine require more than one dose? \n\nFor the most recently available vaccines, yes. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require two shots. The interval between shots for the Pfizer vaccine is 21 days and for the Moderna vaccine, its 28 days. \nThe first shot starts building protection and the second shot strengthens the immune response. Both doses are necessary in order to ensure the vaccine’s effectiveness. The vaccines are not interchangeable, so individuals should complete the second dose with the same vaccine.\n\nWhat’s the difference between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines?\n\nCurrently, two vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are authorized and recommended to prevent COVID-19. At this point, one COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended over the other as both show similar efficacy. \nOne difference is in how the vaccines are stored. While both vaccines need to be kept cold, the Moderna vaccine must be stored at a temperature of a regular refrigerator freezer and can be used within 30 days after thawing, while the Pfizer vaccine requires special ultra-cold freezers and must be used with five days after thawing.\n\nWill the vaccine cause side effects? \n\nAs with other vaccines, it is normal to experience some pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, or low-grade fever following the vaccination, which should go away on their own in a day or two. This does not mean that the vaccine has given you COVID-19. These symptoms are typical reactions to most vaccines and are a sign that your immune system is doing exactly what it is supposed to do — building up protection to the disease.\n\nWill the vaccine give me the virus?\n\nNo. The vaccines contain a portion of mRNA, but not live virus. After the spike protein is produced, the mRNA is degraded. A normal immune response can lead to low grade fever or achiness, but this is not harmful. The full benefit of immunity won’t occur until a couple weeks after your second dose (booster dose). The risk of getting infected from someone who is infectious won’t diminish right away after vaccination.\n\nAre there any contraindications to the vaccine?\n\nAccording to the CDC, while rare, anaphylactic reactions have been reported following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Individuals with a history of an immediate allergic reaction (of any severity) to an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components might be at greater risk for anaphylaxis upon re-exposure to either mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. \nThese individuals should be evaluated by an allergist-immunologist to determine if they can safely receive the vaccine. Individuals with a history of an immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a vaccine or injectable therapy, and individuals with a history of anaphylaxis due to any cause, should be observed for 30 minutes following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. All other individuals should be observed for 15 minutes. Allergic reactions not related to vaccines, such as food or environmental allergies, are not a contraindication or precaution to vaccination with either mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nI’ve heard that you shouldn’t get the COVID-19 vaccine if you’ve recently had a vaccination of a different type — flu, shingles, etc. Is this true?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that you wait at least 14 days before getting any other vaccine, including a flu or shingles vaccine, if you get your COVID-19 vaccine first. And if you get another vaccine first, wait at least 14 days before getting your COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nWhen should I schedule my screening mammogram and COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nA possible side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine is temporarily swollen lymph nodes on the side where the shot is given, which may show up on a mammogram and result in unnecessary diagnostic follow-up. \nIf you are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, it is recommended that you schedule your screening mammogram before getting your first COVID-19 vaccine dose, or four weeks following your second vaccine dose. This does not apply to mammograms for symptomatic patients or to diagnostic mammograms, which should not be delayed. As always, talk with your healthcare provider about what is best for you. If you’ve had the COVID-19 vaccine and are already scheduled for a screening mammogram, let your technologist know that you were vaccinated and in which arm you got your shot. \n\nHow long will it take after I get the vaccine to be protected from COVID-19?\n\nThose who receive the two-dose vaccine will develop maximum immunity several weeks after the second dose. It normally takes about 2-3 weeks for cellular immunity to develop and several weeks for full antibody development.\n\nOnce I’ve had a vaccine, can I stop wearing masks?\n\nNo, you should continue to wear a mask after receiving the vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were around 95% effective in trials for preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19. We don’t, however, know the vaccine’s effect on asymptomatic infection or transmission of the virus. It will be several months before the overall risk of exposure is low because so many others have been immunized. Until most of the population is vaccinated, wearing masks, distancing and handwashing are the only tools we have to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nHow can I protect myself from getting COVID-19 until I get the vaccine?\n\nThe best defense against COVID-19 is to continue following safety precautions. Cover your mouth and nose with a face mask when around others, avoid close contact with people who are sick, stay at least 6 feet away from people outside of your household, avoid crowds and wash your hands often and thoroughly.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, China.\nCOVID-19 has spread throughout the world, including the United States, since it was distinguished and was stated a public health emergency for the U.S. on January 31, 2020 to aid the nationâs healthcare community in responding to the threat.\nThe World Health Organization announced March 11, 2020 that the spread of coronavirus qualifies as a global pandemic.\nIn addition, Governor JB Pritzker delivered a disaster proclamation on March 9, 2020 concerning COVID-19 gives the state access to federal and state resources to combat the spread.\nOn Friday, March 13, Governor Pritzker announced all schools will close from Tuesday, March 17 thought Monday, March 30 to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 across Illinois.\nView the Governorâs news release.\nOn Sunday, March 15, Govenor Pritzker ordered all Illinois bars and restaurants to close to the public as of close of business Monday, March 16 through March 30.View the Governorâs news release.\nThe Bureau, Putnam, Marshall County Health Departments, along with local health departments in the region, local healthcare partners, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are observing this closely and working to protect the publicâs health.\nCOVID-19 Symptoms:\nIndividuals who become sick with COVID-19 develop mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of:\n\nfever\ncough\ndifficulty breathing\n\n* These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure (based on the incubation period of MERS-CoV viruses).\nHow Does It Spread?\nEven though the virus that causes COVID-19 probably emerged from an animal source, it is now spreading from person to person. It is thought to spread mainly between individuals who are within six feet of one another through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is also possible that individuals can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or an object that has the virus on it and then continue to touch their own mouth, nose, and eyes. Although this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Learn more here!\nWhat to do if you were potentially exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19? Learn more here!\nHow Is It Treated?\nThere is not a specific antiviral treatment to treat COVID-19 at this time, though it is being studied. Individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should seek medical care from a health care professional to help relieve symptoms.\nHow Is COVID-19 Diagnosed?\nDiagnosis occurs through laboratory testing of respiratory specimens and serum (blood). At this time, the COVID-19 strain can only be detected at a public health laboratory.\nIs there any way for me to self-test?\nCurrently the CDC offers an online Coronavirus Self-Checker.\nThe purpose of the Coronavirus Self-Checker is to help you make decisions about seeking appropriate medical care. This system is not intended for the diagnosis or treatment of disease or other conditions, including COVID-19. This system is intended only for people who are currently located in the United States.\nThis project was made possible through a partnership with the CDC Foundation and is enabled by Microsoftâs Azure platform. CDCâs collaboration with a non-federal organization does not imply an endorsement of any one particular service, product, or enterprise.\nLearn more here!.\nHow Can I Protect Myself and My Family?\nAs with any respiratory virus, you can protect yourself and others by taking every day preventative actions:\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\nStay home when you are sick.\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\n** Please remember that it is also flu season and BPMHD recommends taking everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs, and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.\nDo I Need To Wear A Mask?\nThe BPMHD recommends face masks be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are caring for an individual in a close setting; at home or in a health care facility.\nWhat Can Travelers Do To Protect Themselves and Others?\nIf you travel, take the following routine precautions:\n\nAvoid contact with sick people.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\nClean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%â95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.\nIt is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.\n\nThe latest travel updates are available on CDCâs COVID-19 web page for travelers.\nWhat If I Recently Traveled To A Country Or Area Affected By COVID-19 And Got Sick?\nIf you were in a country or area with a COVID-19 outbreak and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, within 14 days after you left, you should:\n\nSeek medical advice â Call ahead before you go to a doctorâs office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.\nAvoid contact with others.\nNot travel on public transportation while sick.\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.\nWash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to avoid spreading the virus to others.\nWash your hands with soap and water immediately after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%â95% alcohol.

Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as a sore arm, headache, chills or fever. These symptoms are normal and are signs the body is building immunity.You can expect side effects to go away without complication or injury within about a day or two. Remember, these are signs that your immune system is responding to the vaccine and building immunity.\nI already had COVID-19, should I still get the vaccine?\nNot enough is known about how long natural immunity lasts for those that have recovered from the virus. The CDC is still learning more about natural immunity to COVID-19.  The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will make recommendations to CDC on who should get a COVID-19 vaccine.The vaccine can increase your protection from the virus.\nI’m healthy.  Why do I need to be vaccinated?\nWhile you may be healthy, many individuals in our community have risk factors for getting serious complications from COVID-19 infection. Getting a COVID-19 vaccination protects you so you may protect others around you as well.\nI’m nervous about getting the vaccine.  What should I do?\nIt’s normal to be nervous about something new and to have questions.  We encourage you to ask questions and get answers to your questions from reliable sources.  We recommend looking for information from the CDC, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), both state health departments, and our local health departments.As it gets closer to the time when the vaccine may be available for you, your healthcare provider will also be a great resource to talk with about the COVID-19 vaccine.\nOnce I receive the vaccine, will I still need to wear a mask and social distance?\nWe will still need to wear masks and practice physical distancing until a large proportion of the population is vaccinated and we are sure the vaccine provides long-term protection. Initially, we will not have enough vaccine to vaccinate everyone who wants the vaccine and the virus still will be transmitted.\nWhat can you tell us about the new method of vaccine being used, called mRNA vaccines? \nThey cannot give someone COVID-19.mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19.They do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way.mRNA stimulates the body’s cells to produce a protein that looks like the COVID virus to our immune system. This kickstarts the product of antibodies that fight the actual virus.mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept.The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it does its job.\nWhen will children be given the vaccine?\nThe Moderna vaccine has included children in its clinical trials. We expect more information about results when the Moderna vaccine receives emergency use authorization from the FDA. This could be as early as next week.If a pediatric vaccine is approved, children will be prioritized along with all of other groups.  Some may fit in with other groups, including those with chronic disease, essential workers, etc.\nSources for these answers\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.htmlhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/vaccines-faqhttps://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/resources/general-resources/frequently-asked-questions+covid-19-vaccine\nIf you were tested at the Camden Center, QCCA Expo Center or TaxSlayer Center test site, you can get results by:\n\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-25-21\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-24-21\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-23-21\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-22-21\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-20-21\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-19-21\nCOVID-19 QC Coalition Media Briefing 2-18-21\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-18-21\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-17-21\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-15-21 & 2-16-21\nCOVID-19 Media Briefing 2-14-21\nCOVID-19 QC COALITION MEDIA BRIEFING 02-09-21\nCOVID-19 Coalition 12-10-20\nFor County Level COVID-19 Risk Metrics, visit www.dph.illinois.gov/countymetrics\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) in coordination with the Illinois Poison Control Center have launched the Illinois COVID-19 Hotline and email address to answer questions clinicians and the general public may have regarding  COVID-19.\nIllinoisans can dial 1-800-889-3931 twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week or email DPH.SICK@ILLINOIS.GOV to get their questions answered.\n\nMore information\nhttps://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/restore-illinois-mitigation-planhttps://governor.iowa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Summary%20of%20Enhanced%20Public%20Health%20Measures_final.pdfhttps://www.scottcountyiowa.gov/health/post/do-masks-prevent-covid-19https://togetherqc.com/2020/10/mask-mandate-local-initiative/TogetherQC.comiowa.govhttps://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19https://www.dph.illinois.gov/regionmetrics?regionID=2https://www.dph.illinois.gov/countymetrics?county=Rock%20Islandhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/Covid19Response.aspxhttps://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/long-term-care-facility-outbreaks-covid-19 CDC COVID-19 webpageWhat is COVID-19?

This is only a waiting list and we do not know how soon it will be before we will be able to actually schedule you for an appointment due to the shortage.   If you are on the waitlist, please do not call back to check up if we are making appointments yet.  \n\nFor our 1st Dose Clients Already Scheduled:  We have enough vaccine for our clinics on February 18th and 25th, so if you currently have an appointment, you are all set and there are no changes or cancellations and you will also be able to receive your 2nd dose when the time comes.  IF you feel that you cannot make it to your appointment, please call us and we can reschedule you IF you already had an appointment.  \nFor our 2nd Dose clients:  If you have already received your 1st dose or are already scheduled for your 1st dose, we have enough vaccine to cover your 2nd dose throughout the end of March.  2nd dose vaccines are always a priority and are automatically sent.   \nThis is extremely frustrating for all of us.  We will update our website, Facebook, and the local media of changes along the way.  We hope this shortage is temporary as CDC begins to push more vaccine through.    \n\n\n\n\nIDPH is requiring that both Race and Ethnicity is indicated for our registration process to ensure that our most vulnerable populations are being seen.  The necessary consent form to be filled out prior to coming to our clinics is below. You can also click here:  Moderna Covid 19 Consent Form   .  Please make sure you read and scroll through all the information as there is another form to be filled out and information you need to have.  If you bring the original form to our clinics, we will have a quick sheet for you to fill out with the necessary demographics.  \n\nIf you are 65 and older, and a resident of Vermilion County, you may have the opportunity to receive a vaccine through our partner Carle Hoopeston Regional Health Center (CHRHC). CHRHC is hosting clinics at their hospital in Hoopeston and at the Village Mall in Danville. Please do not call your providers office. Check your MyCarle account for scheduling options, or call (217) 902-6100.    \n\nOSF HealthCare is offering the COVID-19 Vaccine to patients by appointment only. Patients will receive an invite for their appointment via OSF MyChart, email, or phone. OSF is currently prioritizing patients using age (greater than 65) with additional risk factors to ensure patients most at risk receive the vaccination first.  \nPlease remember that our county gets a limited amount of vaccine each week that is divided between VCHD and our hospitals.  We are working with both Carle and OSF to offer as many vaccine appointments as possible.  \nIf you are coming for your 2nd dose, PLEASE Fill out the below paperwork again and PLEASE bring your vaccine card back with you!\nNEW – PLEASE, if you have an appointment, please DO NOT come more than 5 minutes before your appointment.  We schedule 30 people per 15 minutes and it can cause congestion if you come to our clinic prior to your scheduled time.  \n\n\n\nVaccine Appointments are currently at the Fischer Theatre.  Please come AT your appointment time. We have made appointments every 15 minutes, so getting to your appointment early will only cause a lot of congestion.    You MUST bring your paperwork with you.  This makes the process go much quicker.  The forms that need to be filled out are below.  PLEASE read the following information to make sure you can receive the vaccine.  *  If you cannot print out the forms, you can come to the health department to pick up the forms or we can mail them to you.  *\nPlease be patient as Phase 1b includes about 32,000 people in our area. This is going to take a long time to vaccinate our community. We are currently working with our hospitals and other partners to spread out the opportunities for the community to get vaccinated.\n\n\nPhase 1A\n\nEMS\nHospital Based Staff\nClinic Facility Staff\nHome-health personnel\nPharmacy Staff \nOther medical staff (dental, school nurses, opt., etc)\nOther healthcare workers\n\nLong Term Care staff will receive their vaccine through the Pharmacy Partnership Program\nPhase 1B\n\nAge 65+\nFirst Responders (Fire, Law Enforcement, 911 workers, security personnel, school officers)\nEducation (Congregate Child Care, Pre-K through 12th Grade) Food and Agriculture (processing, plants, veterinary health, livestock services, animal care)\nManufacturing (Industrial production of good for distribution to retail, wholesale or other manufacturers\nCorrection Workers and Inmates\nUnited States Postal Services Workers\nPublic Transit Workers (flight crew, bus drivers, train conductors, taxi drivers, para0-transit drivers, in-person support, ride sharing services)\nGrocery Store  Workers (Baggers, cashiers, stockers, pick-up, customer service)\nShelters / Adult Day Care\nBeginning February 25th:  those under 65 with underlying health conditions.   \n\n\nPLEASE READ:\nTo get vaccinated, you must sign the consent form and the pre-screening form below and fill out all the information BEFORE you come to the vaccination location and BRING all paperwork with you.  You will be asked to remain in an observation area for 15-30 minutes post vaccination*.\n\nYou MUST have an appointment to get a vaccine.  \nPlease wear short sleeves.  This will make it easier and quicker for people to get through the vaccine station.  \nIf this is your 2nd dose, please fill out the paper below and also bring your vaccine card back with you.\nIf you answer “Yes” to being pregnant or breastfeeding ,  you must have a doctor’s note saying you can receive the vaccine.\n*If you answer “Yes” to having a history of allergic reactions, taking blood thinners, or autoimmune system, you will be asked to remain in observation for 30 minutes.\nIf you answer “Yes” to having received passive antibody therapy as treatment for COVID-19, you will need to WAIT 90 days after initial infection before getting your vaccine.\nIf you answer “Yes” to having a vaccine in the last 14 days, you must wait 14 days after your last vaccine to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\nIf you are currently in isolation due to a current infection with COVID-19, you CANNOT receive the vaccine at this time.  \nIf you have a fever or are currently ill, you CANNOT receive the vaccine.\nIf you recently received your 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, you cannot get your second dose until 28 days after your 1st dose.\nIf you received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for your first dose, the only vaccine we are administering at this point is Moderna and you will NOT be able to get your second dose here.\nIf you have had COVID19 in the last 90 days, Vaccination can be offered, but could also be delayed 90 days if desired.\n\n \nModerna Covid 19 Consent Form (CLICK HERE FOR FORM) – UPDATED VERSION 2/8/21\n  Moderna Pre-Vaccination-Screening-Form (this has the screening questions and information about each question) – page 2 is blank for printing purposes.

VNA is currently receiving vaccine from the Health Department and vaccinating in the order outlined in the State of Illinois plan. Once an individual signs up on the VNA Waitlist, VNA’s vaccination team will review the responses given to the questions and will know which vaccine distribution phase the individual belongs in. In the form, an individual will indicate that they would like an alert that they are now able to receive the vaccine and this will be sent when the time comes by email and text along with a link to a consent form. Once this is received, the individual will be able to select an appointment that is convenient for them and they will receive directions about what they need to bring to their appointment. Please note, that each phase may take months to complete and there may be a delay before you are contacted to receive a vaccination, especially if you are a young and healthy individual who is not an essential worker. We appreciate your patience as you wait for VNA to contact you. \r\nNO APPOINTMENTS for COVID-19 vaccinations can be made at VNA’s appointment call center.\n2Where will I go to receive my vaccination from VNA?Currently VNA is administering vaccines at two of our locations, at 400 N Highland Avenue in Aurora and at 801 Villa Street in Elgin. VNA will expand vaccine administration to additional VNA locations as more vaccine becomes available. \n3Will I have to pay to get vaccinated for COVID-19?No. COVID-19 vaccinations are free for all individuals, with or without insurance. VNA is not charging Medicare, Medicaid or insurance for the COVID-19 vaccination. \n4Different COVID-19 Vaccines are expected to be available. Which one should I take?Any COVID-19 vaccine receiving an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to be effective.  Data available at this point would suggest that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are very similar in their abilities to produce immunity to the virus. The recommendation would be to take whatever vaccine is made available to you and be sure to receive the second dose of that same vaccine at the appropriate time. If you choose not to get a second dose, you may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.\n5What are the side effects of being vaccinated against COVID-19?Most side effects are minimal and go away in a few days. These can include: pain where shot was given, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and chills.\r\n\n6How do you decide who is vaccinated first?VNA is vaccinating individuals based upon the vaccination phase we are in which is established by the Illinois Department of Public Health. For example: 1 A – Healthcare Workers; 1B – Frontline Essential Workers and Individuals over age 65 etc.\n7How old must you be to get vaccinated against COVID-19?There is currently no pediatric vaccine available. You must be at least 18 years old to receive Moderna vaccine and 16 years old to receive the Pfizer vaccine. Please bring proof of age.\n8Will undocumented people be able to get the vaccine?All populations in Illinois, including individuals who are undocumented, can receive the vaccine. No one will be turned away when it is their time to be vaccinated. \n9Who shouldnt get vaccinated?There are some people for whom the COVID-19 vaccination is not yet recommended. These include children under the age of 16 as this vaccine has been developed and tested so far on adults only and there is currently no pediatric vaccine available. Also, if you have COVID-19 symptoms or are currently positive for COVID-19, you should wait until after your isolation period has ended before being vaccinated. If you have are unsure about whether vaccination is the right choice for you, please talk to your healthcare provider. If you do not have a primary care provider and would like to receive care from a VNA physician or nurse practitioner please call, 630.892.4355. \n10I’ve had COVID – should I still get vaccinated?Yes!  Public health guidelines recommend vaccination for individuals over the age of 16.\n11I am pregnant or plan to become pregnant, should I still get vaccinated?If you are pregnant, VNA recommends you discuss vaccination with your health care provider per CDC guidelines. Visit the CDC website for further information: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html. If you do not have a health care provider and would like to obtain one, please call VNA at 630.892.4355.\n12I am breastfeeding – should I still get the COVID-19 vaccination?There are no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women or on the effects of mRNA vaccines on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. According to guidance from the CDC, mRNA vaccines are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant. Women who are breastfeeding and are part of a group recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, such as healthcare personnel, may choose to be vaccinated and should discuss this with their healthcare provider if they need further advice. Visit the CDC website for further information: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html.\n13I’ve got a health condition and so I’m not sure whether I should be vaccinated, what should I do?Talk with your Primary Care Provider (PCP). If you do not have a primary care provider and would like to receive care from a VNA physician or nurse practitioner please call, 630.892.4355. \r\n\r\n\n14I have allergies. Is this vaccine safe for me?While serious allergic reactions were not seen in vaccine clinical trials of thousands of patients, rare allergic reactions to vaccines are possible. If you have a history of serious allergic reactions, you should discuss your situation with your healthcare provider. The COVID-19 vaccine does not contain any animal products such as eggs.\n15If I have had another vaccine such as the flu shot, can I still get my COVID-19 shot?If you have had another vaccine such as the flu shot, you must wait a full fourteen days before you are eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Also, after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine you must wait at least 14 days before receiving another vaccine such as the flu shot.\n16I understand the vaccination requires two shots. Why, and what if I am unable (or do not want) to get a second shot?The COVID-19 vaccines currently available require two shots to be fully effective. This helps make sure that enough antibodies are being produced to provide effective and long-lasting protection. The first dose of the vaccine will provide some amount of protection, but the recommendation is to receive two doses to be fully protected as intended. \n17How will I know when to get my second shot?  Currently, CDC recommends 2 doses of Moderna vaccine separated by 28 days. CDC currently recommends 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine separated by 21 days. VNA will text or email you an invitation to make an appointment for a second dose based upon CDC recommendations in effect at that time. \n18If I get vaccinated, can I stop wearing a mask?No. While the COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective, it is not 100% effective. That means that there is still a small chance that you could get infected. If you’ve been vaccinated, it may be possible for enough of the virus to be present in your nose or mouth for you to unknowingly spread it to those around you, even if you don’t experience symptoms. Until researchers confirm that this doesn’t happen, wearing a mask helps you protect the people in your community who haven’t received the vaccine yet. Until the COVID-19 pandemic is controlled, people who receive the vaccine need to continue following Illinois Department of Public Health guidance such as the use of facemasks, social distancing, and regular hand washing. This protects you as well as your family and community.','No content','60506','400 North Highland Avenue Aurora 60506',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 11:28:35','2021-02-27 11:28:42','VNA Health Care','IL','div|entry-content'),(275,12,'https://www.walmart.com/cp/1228302','Health ServicesYour Prescriptions$4 PrescriptionsPharmacy in the AppPharmacy ServicesHealth & Insurance ResourcesOther Health ServicesMedication Aids\n\n\n\n\nVer en Español\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccinesAvailable in select locations based on eligibility.Schedule now See more','No content','60620','7535 S Ashland Ave Chicago 60620',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 11:31:10','2021-02-27 11:31:10','Walmart Pharmacy','IL','div|page-content-wrapper Container'),(276,12,'https://warrencohealth.com/covid-19.html','No content','No content','61462','http://galesburg.website/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Appointments-full-2-26-2021.jpg\n\n240 S MAIN ST MONMOUTH 61462',1,NULL,'2021-02-27 11:33:22','2021-02-27 11:33:22','WARREN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT','IL','div|wrapper'),(277,12,'http://www.wchdil.com/','Our Mission\nThe Wayne County Health Department is dedicated to working with individuals, other health care providers, community agencies and organizations, and the community at large--to monitor, guard, improve and protect health and safety in our community.\nOur Responsibilities\nâ¢Plan for Prevention Health Needs of Community: collect and assess community health data, develop policies and programs based on community need, and work with other providers to assure community health needs are being met.\nâ¢Monitor and Respond to Disease Outbreaks: collect information on all communicable disease cases and who their contacts are, to limit and prevent the spread of disease. \nâ¢Plan for and respond to a disaster or bioterrorism event in our community: work with other agencies and health care and emergency response professionals to plan for a unified response to disaster. \nâ¢Protect the Environment: inspect and license all food services, private sewage systems and private water sources.\n â¢Provide Clinical Preventive Services: immunizations and screenings are provided with a focus on individuals undeserved by the private system. \nâ¢Provide prevention education to help individuals stay healthy.\n â¢Assist targeted high risk groups in seeking medical and social services.\nThe Wayne County Health Department is working to improve health and safety in Wayne County.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Direction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Pfizer EUA for Vaccine Recipients \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Moderna Vaccine EUA for Recipients \n        \n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Covid-19 Vaccination  Phase  for Wayne County per IDPH:\n Phase 1a, 1b & 1b Part 2 - Prioritized Groups\nDrive Thru Clinic Date and Time at WCHD:\n  February 26, 2021 from 8:30 am until vaccine is depleted \nWe encourage the public to be aware of the possibility of hazardous road conditions and low temperatures.

Please use the outside entrance.\nImportant Vaccine Updates\nPlease read these important updates on the vaccine rollout. This will be updated regularly.\nUpdates from the State of New Jersey\nUpdate from Morris County: 1/15/21\n\nTo register for a vaccination appointment at the Morris County Regional COVID-19 Vaccination Center, go to: https://bit.ly/3onkSkC\nEffective, January 14, individuals 16-64 with certain medical conditions, as defined by the CDC, and individuals 65+ are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in New Jersey. These individuals join health care workers, individuals in high-risk congregate care settings, and first responders as eligible.\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for persons 16 years of age and older under the FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization, however the Moderna vaccine is recommended for individuals 18 years and older. Not all sites administer both vaccines, so it is important to check with your vaccination site before scheduling a visit to ensure you are eligible.\nThe Morris County Regional COVID-19 Vaccination Center is switching to Pfizer as of Jan. 15, 2021. Important to note:  The vaccine may change again, depending on what is made available to the center.\nIndividuals who are pregnant and those in an immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant are also eligible but should follow CDC guidance and first discuss vaccination with their medical provider before receiving the vaccine.\nSmoking is included as a risk factor on the CDC list of high risk conditions and individuals 16-64 with a smoking addiction are now eligible for the vaccine. Smoking put individuals at higher risk for more severe disease. If an individual who smokes get COVID, they face a significantly high risk for severe complications, mechanical ventilation, and death.  Our goal is to save as many lives as possible and to promote vaccination among the groups at highest risk. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US as well as in NJ (except for COVID-19). We encourage anyone who smokes to quit, and to seek support through our Quitline at www.njquitline.org\nVaccinations are available to individuals who live, work, or are being educated in New Jersey. So some individuals who are not NJ residents may be vaccinated in this State. Some county-operated sites may restrict vaccination at their locations to those who work, live, or are being educated in their county. However, the State encourages all vaccination sites to make appointments available to all eligible individuals.\nResidents of group homes and long-term care facilities are currently eligible for a vaccine and permitted to schedule an appointment at an open vaccine location.\nAn announcement regarding the remainder of essential workers and individuals at high risk who will be eligible under Phase 1B and Phase 1C will be forthcoming.\nThe movement between vaccination eligibility phases is fluid. One phase may overlap with another- not all individuals in one phase will be vaccinated before opening to additional groups.\nInformation about the number of doses administered in the State and demographic information can be found on the COVID Dashboard.\nThe State of New Jersey will open a consumer call center to assist individuals without internet access in scheduling appointments, and will assist in answering general inquiries and questions.\nThe vaccination of individuals in high-risk, congregate care settings such as nursing homes, assisted living residences, IDD group homes, etc. is expected to take weeks. Doses for these settings have already been reserved in the State’s allocation. These efforts are primarily driven by the Federal Pharmacy Partnership LTC program (Walgreens/CVS) who is prioritizing vaccination in skilled nursing facilities/nursing homes and assisted living residences first. Those in other congregate care settings are a priority but may not have been contacted by the pharmacy program or DOH on their status yet.\nHealth care workers eligible in Phase 1A include paid and unpaid persons working in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to infectious material – regardless of their employment status, professional credentials, or the setting where care is provided. There is no exhaustive list of each eligible health care worker-this was intentionally broad so the State does not exclude anyone who should otherwise be eligible.\nIndividuals who are providing paid or unpaid health care services, like essential caregivers (i.e. a daughter caring for her elderly mother with severe neurological disorder in her home instead of her mother receiving care in a nursing facility) are currently eligible for the vaccine as health care workers.\nCOVID-19 vaccines will be made available to individuals regardless of insurance coverage status. Individuals won’t pay coinsurance, deductibles, or copayments. Providers that administer vaccinations to patients without health insurance or whose insurance does not provide coverage of vaccination administration fees may not charge enrollees directly for any vaccine administration costs.\nAll members of the public can be directed to the NJ COVID-19 Information Hub, covid19.nj.gov, for information about vaccination eligibility and how to make an appointment.\n\n\n \nEligibility\nNew Jersey is rolling out the vaccines in a phased approach until large quantities of vaccines become readily available.

Lakshmi Halasyamani, MD, Chief Medical Officer shared her information about how the COVID-19 vaccination works, statistics on how Illinois’s rollout is going and a Q and A session with questions from the community. Watch the archived live stream below.\n\nWhy Im Vaccinating\n\n\nPrevious Slide◀︎ Next Slide▶︎\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine FAQsGeneral Vaccine and Vaccination Information \n\nWhen can I receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe State of Illinois is in Phase 1b which provides vaccine access to residents age 65 and older, and frontline essential workers. With the guidance of our public health colleagues, NorthShore will be focused on contacting our current patients age 65+ by email with steps to prepare to receive the vaccine as we get doses from the appropriate public health agencies. While frontline essential workers also are in Phase 1b, NorthShore will not be vaccinating this population unless they are 65 or older. Frontline essential workers under the age of 65 can receive vaccine access information by contacting their local public health agencies.\n\nLake County Health Department or 847.377.8000\nCity of Evanston Health & Human Services or 3-1-1 or 847.448.4311\nVillage of Skokie Health Department or 847.933.8252\nCook County Department of Public Health or 708.836.4755\nChicago Department of Public Health or 3-1-1 or 312.746.4835\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I am 65 years old or older, should I contact my NorthShore physician to schedule a vaccine?\n\nNo. All vaccine clinic appointments must be scheduled via NorthShoreConnect and not through individual NorthShore and Swedish physician offices. NorthShore will be setting up several regional vaccine clinic locations for the 65+ population. It’s estimated we have approximately 200,000 patients age 65 and older eligible to be vaccinated in Phase 1b. How quickly this large population can receive vaccinations will depend on the available supply of vaccine doses we receive from the state. If you are a current patient and at least 65 years old, please follow these steps to ensure you are prepared.\n\n\n\n\nWill NorthShore call me directly or charge me money to help me set up my NorthShoreConnect account?\n\nNorthShore will never call and charge you money to help you sign-up for NorthShoreConnect. Further, we will never ask for remote access to your computer. If you were to ever receive such a call, do not provide any information and please hang up.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if someone is under age 65 but has underlying health conditions. Can they be moved up to Phase 1b?\n\nUnfortunately, no. This population will be part of the next cohort group in Phase 1c. No timeline has currently been set for vaccinations to begin for that phase.\n\n\n\n\nIs there a specific vaccine deemed to be most effective for those age 65 and older?\n\nNo. There’s no substantive difference between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in terms of efficacy for any age group or population.\n\n\n\n\nHow is NorthShore receiving its COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nNorthShore receives its COVID-19 vaccine allocations through the public health infrastructure. Currently we’re only vaccinating Phase 1a participants which include healthcare workers and will be transitioning to Phase 1b for those 65 years and older. As the COVID-19 vaccine distribution evolves and we expand the vaccine eligibility phases, we will update our processes and outreach.\n\n\n\n\nAre there any individual factors that might make me ineligible to receive the vaccine?\n\nThe CDC’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices has published its guidance on special populations, and it supports offering the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to individuals age 16 and older, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to individuals age 18 and older. The only absolute contraindication is for individuals with a known anaphylactic reaction to any of the components in the vaccine, in particular to polyethylene glycol. Click here for full details on this clinical guidance.\n\n\n\n\nWho is included in the next phase and when will it begin?\n\nThe State of Illinois is now in Phase 1b which includes residents age 65 and over, and frontline essential workers. We do not know when Phase 1c will begin. For more information on the phases and the vaccination itself read the IDPH Phased Vaccination Plan. \n\n\n\n\nWhy are some states already administering the vaccine to the public while others are not?\n\nEach state is making its own decisions on adhering to the CDC recommendations, resulting in various groups being prioritized to receive the vaccine. We are following the IDPH recommendations.\n\n\n\n\nWhere can I access additional information about how to access the vaccine?\n\nOur colleagues within public health are best equipped to answer your questions. Below, please find contact information for the health department in your area.\n\nLake County Health Department or 847.377.8000\nCity of Evanston Health & Human Services or 3-1-1 or 847.448.4311\nVillage of Skokie Health Department or 847.933.8252\nCook County Department of Public Health or 708.836.4755\nChicago Department of Public Health or 3-1-1 or 312.746.4835\n\n\n\n\n\nI understand there are two doses of the vaccine required, why is that? How long do I need to wait before getting the second dose?\n\nYes, you will need to take both doses of the vaccine from the same manufacturer administered either 21 or 28 days apart. This double dose allows your body to develop a stronger immune response to counter a future infection. Your body also needs the extra exposure time to learn how to most effectively fight off exposure to the virus.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we know about the vaccines’ efficacy?\n\nThe data submitted show that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have an efficacy of at least 90 percent after 2 doses. A vaccine efficacy of 90 percent means that the vaccine will protect 9 out of 10 individuals from contracting the infection. The data also show that vaccinated individuals have more mild symptoms if infected and didn’t need to be hospitalized as often.\n\n\n\n\nDo we know how long the vaccine will protect me against COVID-19? \n\nWhile the vaccine prevented individuals in the clinical trials from getting COVID in the 90 days after completing the vaccine series, we don’t know how long this protection will last beyond that time frame. Both Pfizer and Moderna began their clinical trials in late July, so they’ve been able to follow their volunteers for only six months. It’s conceivable that the vaccines can provide long-lasting protection, or effectiveness could fade away in under a year and require a booster shot annually. We need more data and time to understand how long the vaccine will last.\n\n\n\n\nHow long does it take for the vaccine to become effective?\n\nIt typically takes at least a week after the second vaccine dose or approximately one month after you start the two-vaccine series. That means its possible you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection. So it’s very important that you continue the key safety practices of facemasks, hand hygiene, and social distancing.\n\n\n\n\nCan the vaccinated person still spread COVID-19 once the vaccine takes effect?\n\nWe don’t have data on whether receiving the vaccine keeps you from spreading the virus to others. This means that everyone—whether they have received the vaccine or not—will need to continue to wear facemasks, practice physical distancing and good hand hygiene.\n\n\n\n\nIs the vaccine safe? What is the science data behind it?\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are being distributed under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An FDA committee granted an EUA for the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 10, and the Moderna vaccine will be reviewed a week later. Our recommendations assume that both EUAs will be granted. In order for an EUA to be granted, the data submitted is rigorously reviewed by teams of FDA scientists. But this data is yet to be published in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\n\n\n\nHow do the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work?\n\nBoth are forms of a new type of vaccine that involves injecting mRNA, which replicates the spike protein on the COVID-19 virus. Once you’re injected with the vaccine, your body begins to manufacture the same spike protein to create antibodies to fight it. If you’ve taken the vaccine and are later exposed to COVID-19, the antibodies created inside your body will keep the virus from entering the cells and causing an infection.\n\n\n\n\nIs it a live vaccine? \n\nNo. The two vaccines with EUA contain the virus mRNA (which is like a recipe) for the spike protein on the virus.\n\n\n\n\nCan I get COVID-19 from the vaccine?\n\nNo. While the vaccine doesn’t contain either live or dead virus, you may develop “flu-like” symptoms such as tiredness, fevers or headaches after receiving one or both doses of the vaccine but these usually resolve within three days.\n\n\n\n\nIf someone has previously had COVID-19, should they get the vaccine?\n\nDue to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection is possible, people may be advised to get a vaccine even if they have been sick with the virus before. If you have had an infection in the previous 90 days, you will need to wait for 90 days after you have recovered from your COVID infection.\n\n\n\n\nIf I currently have COVID-19, should I be vaccinated?\n\nNo. If you currently have a COVID-19 infection, you should wait at least 10 days since your symptom-onset or test date with resolving symptoms before receiving the vaccine.\n\n\n\n\nShould cancer patients on immunotherapy get vaccinated?\n\nYes, cancer patients should be vaccinated. Please read our Vaccine Information for Cancer/Immunocompromised Patients.\n\n\n\n\nIf I’m considering pregnancy, am currently pregnant or breastfeeding should I get vaccinated?\n\nThe CDC’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices has stated that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are eligible to receive the vaccine. If you have specific questions, please reach out to your healthcare provider.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve heard the vaccine may cause infertility. Is that true?\n\nThis is a myth. There’s no data to suggest the COVID vaccine causes infertility. There also has been no changes to fertility rates in people who’ve had COVID and have recovered. A few other myths about the vaccine also are unfounded: The vaccine does not insert a “chip” or permanent marker in your genetic material. Both vaccines are mRNA and will naturally degrade over time like other mRNA your body makes. And the vaccine can’t give you COVID.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about this new variant of COVID. Will the vaccines still work?\n\nYes, both vaccines are still considered highly effective for new strains of the COVID virus which primarily has been found to have a higher transmission rate than the first strain.\n\n\n\nVaccine Information for Cancer/Immunocompromised PatientsAdditional guidelines are provided and referenced from The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and The National Cancer Care Network (NCCN).\n\nWill my chemotherapy or other medication which affects my immune system decrease my response to the COVID-19 vaccine? What about for bone marrow transplant patients?\n\nBecause any vaccine relies on the immune system to create the protection against the infection, it is possible that people who are immunocompromised or have a weakened immune system may not have as good of a response to the COVID-19 vaccine. However, in the vaccine administered groups, participants who developed COVID-19 infection had much milder disease. Thus, it is possible that if you receive the vaccine, you may not be fully protected from infection; however, if you develop an infection it is likely to be much milder than without the vaccine. It is not specifically known if patients receiving/who have received a bone marrow transplant would have a different response, and this should be discussed with your transplant physician.\n\n\n\n\nShould I receive the COVID-19 vaccine if I am undergoing treatment for cancer or another condition that may compromise my immune system?\n\nWe recommend that you receive the vaccine when it is available to you. Patients 18-64 years old with underlying health conditions, including cancer and other immunocompromised patients are in “Phase 1c”, which will come next. We do not know at this time when additional allotments will be made available for this group.The only exceptions are:\n\nThose with contraindications unrelated to their cancer.\nPatients who have received a bone marrow transplant in the last 90 days or have a prolonged low blood count from treatment of diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma should check with their oncologist as a delay until recovery of low blood counts may be recommended.\nPatients scheduled for surgery within a few days.\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible that my chemotherapy or other medication which affects my immune system will also increase my response to the COVID-19 vaccine and make me at risk for side effects?\n\nThis is probably not the case, although patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs and other medications that increase the immune system could theoretically have a greater reaction and greater risk of side effects, although this seems not to have been the case with influenza vaccines.\n\n\n\n\nWill the COVID-19 vaccine cause any harmful effects on my cancer?\n\nThis is unknown, but experience with many other vaccines indicates this is quite unlikely. However, because there are significant risks to cancer patients with COVID-19 infection there is likely to be more benefit from the vaccine than any risk to making the cancer worse.\n\n\n\n\nIs there anything we can learn from other vaccines such as the flu vaccine in patients with compromised immune systems?\n\nYes. Some of the questions above had been raised about the yearly influenza (flu) vaccines. We routinely recommend the flu vaccine to our patients with cancer who are immunocompromised or have a weakened immune system. Studies have shown that in cancer patients the flu vaccine is effective for helping to decrease the risk of getting the flu, and even if somewhat less effective, still gives some protection.\n\n\n\n\nIf I have the opportunity to get the vaccine while receiving cancer medicines such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy, is there a best time to receive it?\n\nWe recommend you receive vaccine as soon as it is available to you. IF there are multiple options available to you, try to avoid receiving the vaccine when your blood counts may be low (such as 7-14 days after chemotherapy) to avoid a possible vaccine-associated fever at a time when blood counts are low, and avoid 1-2 days prior to coming to the clinic for a treatment or exam (to avoid being turned away for a vaccine associated fever).\n\n\n\nPotential vaccine side effects and allergic reactions \n\nWhat insights can you provide on any potential vaccine side effects for various populations—including the elderly and younger children?\n\nWe currently only have safety data from the short-term duration of the study trial. This means that we don’t know all of the potential side effects of the vaccine, particularly long-term side effects. We do know that the following have been reported as possible side effects which can last up to a week after receiving the vaccine:\n\nPain and redness at the injection site\nFeeling tired and run down a day after receiving the vaccine\nHeadache, muscle aches, chills, joint pains, or fever\nPossible allergic reaction in individuals with known allergies\n\nThese symptoms are a sign that your immune system is mounting a response to the vaccine which is good, and is to be expected in an immune response. Remember: these symptoms are expected side effects and aren’t allergies. You should complete the two-dose vaccination series.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we know about allergies to vaccines, and the COVID-19 vaccine in particular?\n\nAnaphylaxis after vaccination can be seen with any vaccine or medication. However, it’s rare and often occurs in patients with no prior history of allergic reaction. The risk for anaphylaxis to vaccines has been reported to be approximately one in every million doses. To put this in perspective, the risk of anaphylaxis to penicillin is much higher—approximately one out of 2,000-10,000 courses of treatment.\nThere have been reports of anaphylaxis and allergic reactions to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, most of which are quite mild. Details of these reactions are currently being investigated. Additionally, the Moderna vaccine is known to cause some skin reactions, which alone do not preclude receipt of the second vaccine dose.\n\n\n\n\nWhat precautions are recommended?\n\nBecause rare cases of anaphylaxis to vaccines happen, it’s recommended that vaccines be administered in settings equipped with epinephrine and medical personnel trained to treat allergic reactions. With 21 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine expected to be distributed in the coming weeks, we may see some allergic reactions. That’s why a 15-minute post-observation period is recommended for everyone who is vaccinated at this time. Anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, the observation period will be extended to 30 minutes. Please keep in mind that this a new vaccine and a constantly evolving situation.\n\n\n\n\nAre there other reactions that we have seen so far that I should look out for?\n\nSome individuals experience light-headedness, flushing, or tingling which are not allergic symptoms and are more consistent with a vasovagal response or anxiety. These reactions aren’t allergies to the vaccine and individuals who experience them should receive the second vaccine dose.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I have a reaction that isn’t anaphylaxis? Could it be an allergy to the vaccine itself?\n\nIf you experience hives or itching, shortness of breath, runny nose, congestion, tongue or throat discomfort, these symptoms need to be further discussed with an allergist to determine the best next steps. If you experience any of these type of symptoms, we’ll refer you to NorthShore allergists so you can follow up within 7 days so any additional guidance regarding administration of the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine can be incorporated into your care.\n\n\n\n\nWho shouldn’t receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe Pfizer or Moderna vaccines should NOT be given if you’re known to have anaphylactic reactions to polyethylene glycol—the active ingredient in Miralax or colonoscopy prep. If you’re allergic to any component of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, you should NOT receive it. Click here to review a list of vaccine ingredients and get links to additional resources. If you’ve ever had a negative reaction to any vaccine or injectable therapy, extra caution should be taken—including a 30 minute monitoring after vaccination.\n\n\n\n\nIf I have an antibody deficiency or if I’m currently taking an oral steroids or a biologic such as Xolair, Fasenra, Nucala, Dupixent, or take allergy shots, can I receive a COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not live vaccines and can be administered to these individuals. As with other vaccines, your underlying immune deficient or immune compromised state may prevent you from developing a strong immune response, so remember to mask up, wash up and back up!\n\n\n\n\nI know vaccine information is changing rapidly.

How quickly this large population can receive vaccinations will depend on the available supply of vaccine doses we receive from the state. If you are a current patient and at least 65 years old, please follow these steps to ensure you are prepared.\n\n\n\n\nWill NorthShore call me directly or charge me money to help me set up my NorthShoreConnect account?\n\nNorthShore will never call and charge you money to help you sign-up for NorthShoreConnect. Further, we will never ask for remote access to your computer. If you were to ever receive such a call, do not provide any information and please hang up.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if someone is under age 65 but has underlying health conditions. Can they be moved up to Phase 1b?\n\nUnfortunately, no. This population will be part of the next cohort group in Phase 1c. No timeline has currently been set for vaccinations to begin for that phase.\n\n\n\n\nIs there a specific vaccine deemed to be most effective for those age 65 and older?\n\nNo. There’s no substantive difference between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in terms of efficacy for any age group or population.\n\n\n\n\nHow is NorthShore receiving its COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nNorthShore receives its COVID-19 vaccine allocations through the public health infrastructure. Currently we’re only vaccinating Phase 1a participants which include healthcare workers and will be transitioning to Phase 1b for those 65 years and older. As the COVID-19 vaccine distribution evolves and we expand the vaccine eligibility phases, we will update our processes and outreach.\n\n\n\n\nAre there any individual factors that might make me ineligible to receive the vaccine?\n\nThe CDC’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices has published its guidance on special populations, and it supports offering the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to individuals age 16 and older, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to individuals age 18 and older. The only absolute contraindication is for individuals with a known anaphylactic reaction to any of the components in the vaccine, in particular to polyethylene glycol. Click here for full details on this clinical guidance.\n\n\n\n\nWho is included in the next phase and when will it begin?\n\nThe State of Illinois is now in Phase 1b which includes residents age 65 and over, and frontline essential workers. We do not know when Phase 1c will begin. For more information on the phases and the vaccination itself read the IDPH Phased Vaccination Plan. \n\n\n\n\nWhy are some states already administering the vaccine to the public while others are not?\n\nEach state is making its own decisions on adhering to the CDC recommendations, resulting in various groups being prioritized to receive the vaccine. We are following the IDPH recommendations.\n\n\n\n\nWhere can I access additional information about how to access the vaccine?\n\nOur colleagues within public health are best equipped to answer your questions. Below, please find contact information for the health department in your area.\n\nLake County Health Department or 847.377.8000\nCity of Evanston Health & Human Services or 3-1-1 or 847.448.4311\nVillage of Skokie Health Department or 847.933.8252\nCook County Department of Public Health or 708.836.4755\nChicago Department of Public Health or 3-1-1 or 312.746.4835\n\n\n\n\n\nI understand there are two doses of the vaccine required, why is that? How long do I need to wait before getting the second dose?\n\nYes, you will need to take both doses of the vaccine from the same manufacturer administered either 21 or 28 days apart. This double dose allows your body to develop a stronger immune response to counter a future infection. Your body also needs the extra exposure time to learn how to most effectively fight off exposure to the virus.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we know about the vaccines’ efficacy?\n\nThe data submitted show that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have an efficacy of at least 90 percent after 2 doses. A vaccine efficacy of 90 percent means that the vaccine will protect 9 out of 10 individuals from contracting the infection. The data also show that vaccinated individuals have more mild symptoms if infected and didn’t need to be hospitalized as often.\n\n\n\n\nDo we know how long the vaccine will protect me against COVID-19? \n\nWhile the vaccine prevented individuals in the clinical trials from getting COVID in the 90 days after completing the vaccine series, we don’t know how long this protection will last beyond that time frame. Both Pfizer and Moderna began their clinical trials in late July, so they’ve been able to follow their volunteers for only six months. It’s conceivable that the vaccines can provide long-lasting protection, or effectiveness could fade away in under a year and require a booster shot annually. We need more data and time to understand how long the vaccine will last.\n\n\n\n\nHow long does it take for the vaccine to become effective?\n\nIt typically takes at least a week after the second vaccine dose or approximately one month after you start the two-vaccine series. That means its possible you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection. So it’s very important that you continue the key safety practices of facemasks, hand hygiene, and social distancing.\n\n\n\n\nCan the vaccinated person still spread COVID-19 once the vaccine takes effect?\n\nWe don’t have data on whether receiving the vaccine keeps you from spreading the virus to others. This means that everyone—whether they have received the vaccine or not—will need to continue to wear facemasks, practice physical distancing and good hand hygiene.\n\n\n\n\nIs the vaccine safe? What is the science data behind it?\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are being distributed under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An FDA committee granted an EUA for the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 10, and the Moderna vaccine will be reviewed a week later. Our recommendations assume that both EUAs will be granted. In order for an EUA to be granted, the data submitted is rigorously reviewed by teams of FDA scientists. But this data is yet to be published in the peer-reviewed literature.\n\n\n\n\nHow do the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work?\n\nBoth are forms of a new type of vaccine that involves injecting mRNA, which replicates the spike protein on the COVID-19 virus. Once you’re injected with the vaccine, your body begins to manufacture the same spike protein to create antibodies to fight it. If you’ve taken the vaccine and are later exposed to COVID-19, the antibodies created inside your body will keep the virus from entering the cells and causing an infection.\n\n\n\n\nIs it a live vaccine? \n\nNo. The two vaccines with EUA contain the virus mRNA (which is like a recipe) for the spike protein on the virus.\n\n\n\n\nCan I get COVID-19 from the vaccine?\n\nNo. While the vaccine doesn’t contain either live or dead virus, you may develop “flu-like” symptoms such as tiredness, fevers or headaches after receiving one or both doses of the vaccine but these usually resolve within three days.\n\n\n\n\nIf someone has previously had COVID-19, should they get the vaccine?\n\nDue to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection is possible, people may be advised to get a vaccine even if they have been sick with the virus before. If you have had an infection in the previous 90 days, you will need to wait for 90 days after you have recovered from your COVID infection.\n\n\n\n\nIf I currently have COVID-19, should I be vaccinated?\n\nNo. If you currently have a COVID-19 infection, you should wait at least 10 days since your symptom-onset or test date with resolving symptoms before receiving the vaccine.\n\n\n\n\nShould cancer patients on immunotherapy get vaccinated?\n\nYes, cancer patients should be vaccinated. Please read our Vaccine Information for Cancer/Immunocompromised Patients.\n\n\n\n\nIf I’m considering pregnancy, am currently pregnant or breastfeeding should I get vaccinated?\n\nThe CDC’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices has stated that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are eligible to receive the vaccine. If you have specific questions, please reach out to your healthcare provider.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve heard the vaccine may cause infertility. Is that true?\n\nThis is a myth. There’s no data to suggest the COVID vaccine causes infertility. There also has been no changes to fertility rates in people who’ve had COVID and have recovered. A few other myths about the vaccine also are unfounded: The vaccine does not insert a “chip” or permanent marker in your genetic material. Both vaccines are mRNA and will naturally degrade over time like other mRNA your body makes. And the vaccine can’t give you COVID.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about this new variant of COVID. Will the vaccines still work?\n\nYes, both vaccines are still considered highly effective for new strains of the COVID virus which primarily has been found to have a higher transmission rate than the first strain.\n\n\n\nVaccine Information for Cancer/Immunocompromised PatientsAdditional guidelines are provided and referenced from The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and The National Cancer Care Network (NCCN).\n\nWill my chemotherapy or other medication which affects my immune system decrease my response to the COVID-19 vaccine? What about for bone marrow transplant patients?\n\nBecause any vaccine relies on the immune system to create the protection against the infection, it is possible that people who are immunocompromised or have a weakened immune system may not have as good of a response to the COVID-19 vaccine. However, in the vaccine administered groups, participants who developed COVID-19 infection had much milder disease. Thus, it is possible that if you receive the vaccine, you may not be fully protected from infection; however, if you develop an infection it is likely to be much milder than without the vaccine. It is not specifically known if patients receiving/who have received a bone marrow transplant would have a different response, and this should be discussed with your transplant physician.\n\n\n\n\nShould I receive the COVID-19 vaccine if I am undergoing treatment for cancer or another condition that may compromise my immune system?\n\nWe recommend that you receive the vaccine when it is available to you. Patients 18-64 years old with underlying health conditions, including cancer and other immunocompromised patients are in “Phase 1c”, which will come next. We do not know at this time when additional allotments will be made available for this group.The only exceptions are:\n\nThose with contraindications unrelated to their cancer.\nPatients who have received a bone marrow transplant in the last 90 days or have a prolonged low blood count from treatment of diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma should check with their oncologist as a delay until recovery of low blood counts may be recommended.\nPatients scheduled for surgery within a few days.\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible that my chemotherapy or other medication which affects my immune system will also increase my response to the COVID-19 vaccine and make me at risk for side effects?\n\nThis is probably not the case, although patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs and other medications that increase the immune system could theoretically have a greater reaction and greater risk of side effects, although this seems not to have been the case with influenza vaccines.\n\n\n\n\nWill the COVID-19 vaccine cause any harmful effects on my cancer?\n\nThis is unknown, but experience with many other vaccines indicates this is quite unlikely. However, because there are significant risks to cancer patients with COVID-19 infection there is likely to be more benefit from the vaccine than any risk to making the cancer worse.\n\n\n\n\nIs there anything we can learn from other vaccines such as the flu vaccine in patients with compromised immune systems?\n\nYes. Some of the questions above had been raised about the yearly influenza (flu) vaccines. We routinely recommend the flu vaccine to our patients with cancer who are immunocompromised or have a weakened immune system. Studies have shown that in cancer patients the flu vaccine is effective for helping to decrease the risk of getting the flu, and even if somewhat less effective, still gives some protection.\n\n\n\n\nIf I have the opportunity to get the vaccine while receiving cancer medicines such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy, is there a best time to receive it?\n\nWe recommend you receive vaccine as soon as it is available to you. IF there are multiple options available to you, try to avoid receiving the vaccine when your blood counts may be low (such as 7-14 days after chemotherapy) to avoid a possible vaccine-associated fever at a time when blood counts are low, and avoid 1-2 days prior to coming to the clinic for a treatment or exam (to avoid being turned away for a vaccine associated fever).\n\n\n\nPotential vaccine side effects and allergic reactions \n\nWhat insights can you provide on any potential vaccine side effects for various populations—including the elderly and younger children?\n\nWe currently only have safety data from the short-term duration of the study trial. This means that we don’t know all of the potential side effects of the vaccine, particularly long-term side effects. We do know that the following have been reported as possible side effects which can last up to a week after receiving the vaccine:\n\nPain and redness at the injection site\nFeeling tired and run down a day after receiving the vaccine\nHeadache, muscle aches, chills, joint pains, or fever\nPossible allergic reaction in individuals with known allergies\n\nThese symptoms are a sign that your immune system is mounting a response to the vaccine which is good, and is to be expected in an immune response. Remember: these symptoms are expected side effects and aren’t allergies. You should complete the two-dose vaccination series.\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we know about allergies to vaccines, and the COVID-19 vaccine in particular?\n\nAnaphylaxis after vaccination can be seen with any vaccine or medication. However, it’s rare and often occurs in patients with no prior history of allergic reaction. The risk for anaphylaxis to vaccines has been reported to be approximately one in every million doses. To put this in perspective, the risk of anaphylaxis to penicillin is much higher—approximately one out of 2,000-10,000 courses of treatment.\nThere have been reports of anaphylaxis and allergic reactions to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, most of which are quite mild. Details of these reactions are currently being investigated. Additionally, the Moderna vaccine is known to cause some skin reactions, which alone do not preclude receipt of the second vaccine dose.\n\n\n\n\nWhat precautions are recommended?\n\nBecause rare cases of anaphylaxis to vaccines happen, it’s recommended that vaccines be administered in settings equipped with epinephrine and medical personnel trained to treat allergic reactions. With 21 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine expected to be distributed in the coming weeks, we may see some allergic reactions. That’s why a 15-minute post-observation period is recommended for everyone who is vaccinated at this time. Anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, the observation period will be extended to 30 minutes. Please keep in mind that this a new vaccine and a constantly evolving situation.\n\n\n\n\nAre there other reactions that we have seen so far that I should look out for?\n\nSome individuals experience light-headedness, flushing, or tingling which are not allergic symptoms and are more consistent with a vasovagal response or anxiety. These reactions aren’t allergies to the vaccine and individuals who experience them should receive the second vaccine dose.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if I have a reaction that isn’t anaphylaxis? Could it be an allergy to the vaccine itself?\n\nIf you experience hives or itching, shortness of breath, runny nose, congestion, tongue or throat discomfort, these symptoms need to be further discussed with an allergist to determine the best next steps. If you experience any of these type of symptoms, we’ll refer you to NorthShore allergists so you can follow up within 7 days so any additional guidance regarding administration of the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine can be incorporated into your care.\n\n\n\n\nWho shouldn’t receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe Pfizer or Moderna vaccines should NOT be given if you’re known to have anaphylactic reactions to polyethylene glycol—the active ingredient in Miralax or colonoscopy prep. If you’re allergic to any component of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, you should NOT receive it. Click here to review a list of vaccine ingredients and get links to additional resources. If you’ve ever had a negative reaction to any vaccine or injectable therapy, extra caution should be taken—including a 30 minute monitoring after vaccination.\n\n\n\n\nIf I have an antibody deficiency or if I’m currently taking an oral steroids or a biologic such as Xolair, Fasenra, Nucala, Dupixent, or take allergy shots, can I receive a COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not live vaccines and can be administered to these individuals. As with other vaccines, your underlying immune deficient or immune compromised state may prevent you from developing a strong immune response, so remember to mask up, wash up and back up!\n\n\n\n\nI know vaccine information is changing rapidly. Where can I get my questions answered or get the very latest updates?\n\nThere are several online resource sites that may be helpful:\n\nnorthshore.org/covid19\nIDPH COVID-19 webpage and Coronavirus.illinois.gov\nCDC Homepage for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nChicago Department of Public Health COVID-19 webpage\nIHA webpage on COVID-19\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCOVID Community Checkup\nView more\n\n\n  \nThis week we welcome special guest NorthShore Pediatrician Sharon Robinson, MD, for a dynamic conversation about healthcare mistrust from black and brown communities, how to talk to your friends and family about the hot topic of vaccination, and why the age ranges for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are different.

We will announce widely across many platforms, including the news when that process is available.Clinics and pods have their own registration that is beginning and information can be found here.\nPhase 1A clinicians, can complete a survey for vaccine allocation needs here.\n\nAcronyms and abbreviations used:\n CDC: US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention COVID-19: Coronavirus Disease 2019 EUA: Emergency Use Authorization FDA: US Food & Drug Administration HDOH: State of Hawaii Department of Health VAERS: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System\n\nWhen will a COVID-19 vaccine be available in Hawaii?\nThe first supply of the COVID-19 vaccine was made available in Hawaii starting in mid-December 2020. The number of doses in the initial phase is limited, so most people will have to wait until 2021. Supplies will increase over time, but it is expected that all adults will be able to get vaccinated in the first half of 2021 or soon thereafter. A vaccine for children under 16 will not be available until more studies are completed.\n\nHow much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?\nThe COVID-19 vaccine is a national public health priority purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars and is offered at no cost. However, vaccination providers will be able to charge an administration fee for giving the shot to someone. Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patient’s public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund.\n\nHow many doses of the vaccine are needed and why?\nMost of the COVID-19 vaccines currently being considered for approval in the United States require two shots to be effective. The shots are spaced out by a number of weeks and you will be alerted when to get your second shot. If you have had your first shot, you will automatically be eligible to get the second shot when it is due.\n\nWho are the first people eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\nEligibility recommendations for the first supply of COVID-19 vaccine are based on who is most at risk. In Hawaii, this has been determined to be the following:\nEssential healthcare workers, such as:High-risk healthcare workers involved in direct patient care and workers who provide transportation, environmental services, and other healthcare facility services and who are at risk of exposure to COVID-19Residents and staff of congregate long-term care facilities (e.g., “nursing homes”)Other essential workers, such as:First responders, including police and firefighters; corrections officers; transportation workers; workers in the education sector; food and agriculture workers; and utility employees.Adults with high-risk medical conditionsAdults 65 years of age and older.\nPeople who do not fall within these groups will be able to receive COVID-19 vaccines in coming months as they become available. This information will be made public as it becomes available. You can read about CDC vaccine recommendations at the following site: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations-process.html.\n\nCan a caregiver of Kupuna (age 75+) receive a vaccination at this time?\nThe priority is to vaccinate Kupuna first. Due to limited availability of vaccine, caregivers will not be vaccinated with Kupuna at this time.\n\nWill there be enough vaccine for everyone in Hawaii?\nYes. Although the initial supply is limited, millions more doses are being made and everyone in Hawaii will eventually be able to be vaccinated.\n\nHow will I know when it’s my turn to receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\nHDOH will share this information in a variety of ways as more vaccines become available. You may hear from your healthcare provider, your employer, announcements from state and local leaders, or the media. HDOH maintains the latest information on the vaccine’s status in Hawaii at www.hawaiicovid19.com/vaccine.\n\nCan the COVID-19 vaccine give someone COVID-19?\nNo, you cannot get COVID-19 from the COVID-19 vaccine. The mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19 so it is safe.\n\nIs the COVID-19 vaccine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?\nAt this time, HDOH is following CDC guidance on vaccinating those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. The vaccine has not been studied in pregnant or breastfeeding women and their infants, but mRNA vaccines (including the COVID-19 vaccine) are not thought to pose a risk to these groups. On the other hand, getting COVID-19 is known to put a woman at higher risk of serious illness.If you are pregnant or breastfeeding and you are part of a group that is recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, you may choose to be vaccinated. Other things to consider:\nCOVID-19 risks of severe illness or adverse outcomes are known to be higher for pregnant women and their fetuses.You should talk to your healthcare provider you are seeing for your pregnancy care to discuss whether or not to get a COVID-19 vaccine.Getting the vaccine is a personal decision.\nYou can learn more about vaccines for pregnant women at this CDC site: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/index.html.\n\nIs the COVID-19 vaccine available for children or adolescents?\nSeveral vaccines are being studied and getting recommendations from the FDA and CDC. So far, no vaccine has been studied in children younger than 16, so a COVID-19 vaccine is not yet available for anyone younger than 16. At this time, one recommended vaccine is for people 16 and older, and one recommended vaccine is for people 18 and older. Information will be made public as it becomes available in the coming year.\n\nIf I have already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine when it’s available?\nAt this time there is not enough information to say if or how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again through “natural immunity.” Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID-19 may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this. At least one vaccine has been studied in persons with a prior COVID-19 infection and found to be safe. CDC and HDOH recommend that vaccination should be offered to persons regardless of history of prior COVID-19 infection.\nThere is no recommended minimum wait time between infection and vaccination, current evidence suggests that reinfection is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection. So, persons who had COVID-19 in the past 90 days may choose to wait to be vaccinated until near the end of 90 days, if they want to do so.\nNo one should be vaccinated while they are currently sick with a COVID-19 infection. Vaccinating should be postponed until the person has no more symptoms and criteria have been met for them to discontinue isolation.\n\nCan I take the COVID-19 vaccine with other vaccines, like the flu vaccine?\nNo, you cannot. No other vaccine should be received between 14 days before you receive your COVID-19 vaccine and 14 days afterward.\n\nDo I need to wear a mask when I receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\nYes, you should wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth whenever you are in public and close contact with people outside your household cannot be avoided, such as when you are getting a vaccine shot. (Anyone who has trouble breathing or who is unable to remove a mask without assistance should not wear a mask.)\n\nWill I need to wear a mask and avoid close contact with other people after I have received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine? When can I stop wearing a mask?\nYes, even after you have had both shots, you will need to wear a mask and practice other preventive measures, like avoiding close contact with other people. While experts learn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least 6 feet away from others.\nExperts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before deciding to change recommendations on steps everyone should take to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision. HDOH and state and local leaders will let the public know when it is safe to stop using these preventive measures.\n\nAre there other vaccines that can help prevent me from getting COVID-19? Does getting the annual flu shot help?\nRight now, there are two COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine and COVID-19 Moderna Vaccine. These are the only vaccines that will protect against COVID-19 at this time.However, it is important to also get your annual flu shot during the COVID-19 pandemic. An influenza vaccine (“flu shot”) will not protect you from getting COVID-19, but it may provide several individual health benefits, such as keeping you from getting sick with the flu, reducing the severity of your illness if you do get the flu, and reducing your risk of hospitalization because of the flu.Flu vaccination is very important to keep you healthy and to keep our clinics and hospitals from being overwhelmed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDoes immunity after getting COVID-19 last longer than the protection you would get from a COVID-19 vaccine? How long will the vaccine protect people?\nThe protection someone gains from having an infection (called “natural immunity”) varies depending on the disease, and it varies from person to person. The virus causing COVID-19 is new, so we don’t know how long natural immunity for COVID-19 might last.\nSome early evidence—based on some people—seems to suggest that natural immunity may only last up to 90 days. Regarding COVID-19 vaccine, we don’t know how long immunity lasts until we have more data on how well they work.\nExperts are working hard to learn more about COVID-19, including natural immunity and immunity from vaccines, and CDC and HDOH will let the public know as new evidence becomes available and recommendations change.\n\nDoes the COVID-19 vaccine have any side effects? Can it cause you to get sick?\nClinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccines have found that in general, most people do not have serious problems after being vaccinated.\nAt this time, the side effect that some people have had is a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. If you know you are allergic to any ingredient in one of the vaccines, you should not get that vaccine. If you know you have allergies, but don’t know if you are allergic to an ingredient in the vaccines talk to your provider or the provider offering you the vaccine before getting vaccinated. Some common but temporary side effects may be soreness, redness, or warmth in the arm where they got the shot. These symptoms usually go away on their own within a week. Some people report getting a headache or fever after receiving a vaccine.\nThese side effects are signs that your immune system is working as it should, to build protection against the disease for which you’re being vaccinated.Because each vaccine will have different side effects, it is important that you learn about the specific vaccine you are offered when it’s your turn. Talk to your provider or the provider offering you the vaccine and ask questions before getting vaccinated.\n\nWhat is “herd immunity” and how does it work? What percentage of the population needs to get vaccinated to have herd immunity to COVID-19?\nHerd immunity refers to a situation where most of the population is immune to an infectious disease, either from previous infection or vaccination. This provides indirect protection (i.e., “herd immunity” or “herd protection”) to people who are not immune to the disease because it makes it harder for the disease to spread.\nExperts do not know what percentage of people would need to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity for COVID-19.\n\nIs the COVID-19 vaccine safe?\nThe COVID-19 vaccines being offered to the public meet the US Food & Drug Administration’s (FDA) standards for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). All COVID-19 vaccines were rigorously tested in thousands of people to make sure that they are safe and that they work.\nWhen a vaccine is granted EUA by the FDA, it means the benefits of this vaccine outweigh the harms of becoming infected with COVID-19.It also means that even after the initial studies, safety is continuously checked. There are many safety monitoring systems that watch for adverse effects and possible side effects that were not seen in clinical trials. If an unexpected adverse event is seen, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. Experts then decide whether changes are needed in the vaccine recommendations.\nHDOH is also monitoring for possible adverse events and for any announcements from FDA and CDC. This monitoring is critical to help ensure that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks for people who receive vaccines.\nIf any vaccine was found to be unsafe, FDA, CDC and HDOH would let the public and medical providers know.\n\nHow do I report it if I have a problem or bad reaction after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?\nCDC and FDA encourage the public to report possible side effects (“adverse events”) through VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) and V-safe.\nAn “adverse event” is any health problem that happens after a shot or other vaccine. An adverse event might be truly caused by a vaccine, or it might be pure coincidence (something that happened after vaccination but not caused by the vaccine).\nOne of the main jobs of CDC’s Immunization Safety Office is doing research to find out if adverse events that are reported by doctors, vaccine manufacturers, and the public are truly caused by a vaccine.\nVAERS on the InternetVAERS is a national system that collects data to look for side effects (“adverse events”) that are unexpected, appear to happen more often than expected, or occur in unusual patterns. CDC uses VAERS to monitor the safety of vaccines across the country, which is a top priority. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) can be found at the following website: vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html. \nV-safe on your smartphone You can also use a tool on your smartphone, called V-safe, to tell CDC about any side effects you have after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. V-safe will also provide you reminders if you need a second vaccine dose.V-safe uses text messages and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Through V-safe, you can quickly tell CDC if you have any problems you experience after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Depending on your answers, someone from CDC may call to check on you and get more information.\nYou can learn more about how to register and use V-safe at the following website: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html.\nYou can learn more about the difference between routine side effects and adverse events at this CDC website: www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/sideeffects/index.html.\n\nWhy would a vaccine be needed if we can do other things, like social distancing and wearing masks, to prevent the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading?\nGetting a vaccine is only one of several tools we need to use to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed. Other steps, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask and staying at least 6 feet away from others, help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others.Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC’s recommendations to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from COVID-19. You can learn more about how to protect yourself and others at this CDC website: www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html\n\nWhere can I find out more information?\nFor more information about COVID-19, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019.html.

These groups are at greatest\n                  risk, according to CDC guidance.\nWe’re eager to provide a vaccine to anyone who would like one, but we must\n                  prioritize the highest risk patients due to limited supply. As vaccine supply and\n                  appointment capacity expand, we’ll broaden eligibility. Eligible patients will\n                  be notified and provided with instructions on booking a vaccination appointment. You\n                  don’t need to take additional action at this time.\nHealthcare Workers: Please be prepared to show verification of\n                  your healthcare worker status at your visit. This can be a badge, license, paystub\n                  or other type of identifying paperwork. If youre age 16-17, you can receive the Pfizer\n                  vaccine with consent from your legal guardian. Call (844)\n                  987-6115.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenWhen can more patients and the general public expect to be offered the vaccine?\nWe’re distributing the vaccine in phases according to expert recommendations.\n                  The timeline for distribution depends on vaccine supply and the guidance of public\n                  health officials.\nWe’re currently offering COVID-19 vaccinations to healthcare workers, as\n                  defined by the CDC, and Sutter patients age 65 and older because they’re\n                  at highest risk.\nVaccine supply is limited and unpredictable, and we’re unable to give specific\n                  dates about when we’ll be able to expand eligibility. We’re rapidly expanding\n                  appointment capacity by opening mass vaccination clinics across Northern California.\n                  We’ll notify our eligible patients and provide instructions on booking a vaccination\n                  appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenHow will I know when I’m eligible for vaccination at Sutter?\nCheck our\n                  website for the most up-to-date information about the vaccine rollout. As eligibility\n                  expands, we’ll notify our eligible patients and provide instructions on booking\n                  a vaccination appointment.\nWe need to keep our COVID-19 Vaccine call center and online booking through My\n                  Health Online available to help eligible patients book their vaccination appointments.\n                  If you’re not yet eligible for a vaccine, check our website for updates and\n                  watch for email notifications. Please don’t call or message your provider about\n                  scheduling COVID-19 vaccination appointments. Your provider isn’t able to schedule\n                  COVID-19 vaccination appointments or grant eligibility exceptions. We know there’s\n                  a lot of interest in the vaccine. We appreciate your patience throughout the process.\nIf you’re not yet enrolled in My Health Online, sign\n                  up now to easily schedule appointments, including your COVID-19 vaccination when\n                  it’s your group’s turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenWhat happens if there are unused doses at the end of the day? Is there a waiting list\n                     I can sign up for?\nSutter vaccination sites are making every effort to let no dose go unused. In cases\n                  where there are appointment cancellations or remaining vaccine at the end of the day,\n                  we contact scheduled patients to come in early. All vaccinations are by appointment\n                  only.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenWhat is the cost of getting a COVID-19 vaccine?\nThere’s no out-of-pocket cost to you to get the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\n\n\nOpenDo the COVID-19 vaccines have any side effects? Should I be worried about an allergic\n                     reaction?\nScientists anticipate that most recipients will experience mild to moderate flu-like\n                  side effects, including fatigue, chills, muscle aches and fever. These side effects\n                  should resolve in one to two days, and show your immune system is responding to the\n                  vaccine.\nAfter you receive the vaccine, you need to remain on-site for at least 15 minutes\n                  so we can monitor you for severe allergic reactions and provide immediate treatment\n                  if needed.\nAccording to the CDC, if you’ve had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient\n                  in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available\n                  mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. If you had a severe allergic reaction after getting\n                  the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC\n                  recommends that you should not get the second dose.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenHow many doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will I need?\nBoth vaccines currently available require two doses. You’ll get an initial\n                  vaccination, then a second shot — three weeks later for the Pfizer vaccine or\n                  four weeks later for the Moderna vaccine.\nThe appointment for your second dose will be scheduled during your first appointment.\n                  Please note that you must receive both doses at the same location.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenWill we still need to wear masks and practice physical distancing once a vaccine is\n                     available?\nYes, masking and physical distancing will continue to be critical tools in preventing\n                  transmission until a large percentage of the population is vaccinated. We’re\n                  also awaiting more information about the long-term protection of the vaccines.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenHow do COVID-19 vaccines work?\nVaccines are designed to stimulate the human body’s own protective immune\n                  response, so that if a person is infected, their immune system can recognize the infection\n                  and react to it. While vaccines are developed in different ways using different methods,\n                  it’s important to remember that they can’t give you COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenAre COVID-19 vaccines safe? \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that mRNA vaccines are safe\n                  and effective. The vaccines are held to the same rigorous standards as all other types\n                  of vaccines in the United States. Both vaccines were found to be safe\n                  and effective in tens of thousands of adults who participated in double-blind,\n                  placebo-controlled clinical trials – widely considered the gold standard for\n                  testing pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sutter Health Network of Care\n\nExpertise to fit your needs\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Care\nCheck-ups, screenings and sick visits for adults and children.\n\n\nSpecialty Care\nExpertise and advanced technologies in all areas of medicine.\n\n\nEmergency Care\nFor serious accidents, injuries and conditions that require immediate medical care.\n\n\nUrgent  Care\nAfter-hours, weekend and holiday services.\n\n\nWalk-In Care\nConvenient walk-in care clinics for your non-urgent health needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Sutter\nAbout Our Network\nAnnual Report\nAwards\nCommunity Benefit\nContact Us\nNews\nGiving\n\n\n\n\nFind Care\nBirth Centers \nCare Centers \nEmergency Rooms\nHospitals \nImaging\nLabs\nSurgery Centers\nUrgent Care\nWalk-In Care\nView All >\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Services\nBehavioral Health\nCancer Services\nFamily Medicine\nHome Health and Hospice\nOrthopedics\nPediatrics\nPregnancy\nPrimary Care\nWomens Health\nView All >\n\n\n\n\nPatient Resources\nAccepted Health Plans\nClasses and Events\nEstimate Costs\nFlu Resources\nHealth and Wellness\nMedical Records\nMedicare\nMy Health Online\nPay a Bill\nSymptom Checker\n\n\n\n\nOur Team\nFor Employees\nPhysician Careers\nRecruiting Events\nSutter Careers\nVendors\nVolunteers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADA Accessibility\nContact\nPrivacy\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn Opens new window\nYouTube Opens new window\nFacebook Opens new window\nTwitter Opens new window\nGlassdoor Opens new window\nInstagram Opens new window\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2021 Sutter Health.

In the meantime,\n	 below are answers to the questions we frequently hear about the vaccine.\nCOVID-19 vaccine frequently asked questions for patients\n\nShould I get vaccinated for COVID-19?\n\nWhen can I get the vaccine?\n\nWhat vaccines are available?\n\nWhat is a messenger RNA vaccine?\n\nWhy do I need two COVID-19 shots?\n\nWill the shot hurt or make me sick?\n\nCan I get COVID-19 from the vaccine?\n\nIs the COVID-19 vaccine safe?\n\nIf I already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated?\n\nCan my child get vaccinated for COVID-19?\n\nDo the COVID-19 vaccines affect fertility?\n\nCan I take it if I’m pregnant or nursing my baby?\n\nCan I get the vaccine if I have food or medication allergies?\n\nCan I take the vaccine if I am allergic to eggs?\n\nCan I take the vaccination if I’m allergic to penicillin?\n\nIs the vaccine safe for people with compromised immune systems?\n\nDo I need to wear a mask when I receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nWhere can I find more information about the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nShould I get vaccinated for COVID-19? \nWe strongly recommend you get vaccinated if you are 18 or older. The vaccine\n	 will help protect you from getting COVID-19. If you still get infected\n	 after you get vaccinated, the vaccine may prevent serious illness.\nWhen can I get the vaccine? \nWhen a vaccine is authorized or approved in the United States, there may\n	 not be enough doses available for all adults. Supplies will increase over\n	 time, and all adults should be able to get vaccinated later in 2021. The\n	 goal is for everyone to be able to easily receive a COVID-19 vaccine as\n	 soon as large quantities are available. Several thousand vaccination providers\n	 will be available, including doctors’ offices, retail pharmacies,\n	 hospitals and federally qualified health centers. We will share more information\n	 about vaccine distribution when we have it. Here are the next phases of\n	 vaccine distribution by state:\nCalifornia\n\nPhase 1B tier one includes Individuals 75 and older and those at risk of\n		 exposure at work in the following sectors: education, childcare, emergency\n		 services and food and agriculture.\nPhase 1B tier two includes individuals 65-74 years of age and those at\n		 risk for exposure at work in the following sectors: transportation and\n		 logistics; industrial, commercial, residential and sheltering facilities\n		 and services; critical manufacturing; and congregate settings with outbreak\n		 risk including the incarcerated and homeless.\nPhase 1C includes individuals 50-64 years of age, people 16-49 years of\n		 age who have underlying health condition or disability which increases\n		 the risk of severe COVID-19 and those at risk of exposure at work in the\n		 following sectors: water and wastewater; defense; energy; chemical and\n		 hazardous materials; communications and IT; financial services; and government\n		 operations/community-based essential functions.\n\n		For more information go to\n		https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/#When-can-I-get-vaccinated\n\n\nHawaii\n\nPhase 1a: Healthcare personnel and long-term facility residents\nPhase 1b: Frontline essential workers and adults 75 and older\nPhase 1c: Adults 65 to 74 years, persons 16 to 64 years with high-risk\n		 medical conditions and essential workers not recommended for vaccination\n		 in Phase 1b\n\n\n	For the latest information go to\n	HealthHawaii.gov.\n\nOregon\n\nPhase 1B includes childcare, preschool and K-12 school and school district staff.\n\n		For the latest information go to\n		https://covidvaccine.oregon.gov/\n\n\nWhat vaccines are available? \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Pfizer and\n	 Moderna COVID-19 vaccines for Emergency Use Authorization. Both vaccines\n	 are made with messenger RNA.\nWhat is a messenger RNA vaccine? \nMessenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against\n	 infectious diseases. They teach our cells how to make a protein—or\n	 even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response\n	 inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is\n	 what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies.\nWhy do I need two COVID-19 shots? \nCurrently authorized vaccines, and most vaccines under development, require\n	 two doses. The first shot helps the immune system recognize the virus,\n	 and the second shot strengthens the immune response. You need both to\n	 get the best protection.\nWill the shot hurt or make me sick? \nThere may be side effects, but they should go away within a few days. Possible\n	 side effects include a sore arm, headache, fever or body aches. This does\n	 not mean you have COVID-19. Side effects are signs that the vaccine is\n	 working to build immunity. If they don’t go away in a week, or you\n	 have more serious symptoms, call your doctor.\nCan I get COVID-19 from the vaccine? \nNo. You cannot get COVID-19 from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines because\n	 the virus is not used to produce them.\nIs the COVID-19 vaccine safe? \nCOVID-19 mRNA vaccines go through the same rigorous safety assessment as\n	 all vaccines before the FDA approves them for use in the United States.\n	 This includes large clinical trials and data review by a safety monitoring board.\nIf I already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated? \nYes. CDC recommends that you get vaccinated even if you have already had\n	 COVID-19, because you can catch it more than once. While you may have\n	 some short-term antibody protection after recovering from COVID-19, we\n	 don’t know how long this protection will last.\nCan my child get vaccinated for COVID-19?\nNo. More studies need to be conducted before COVID-19 vaccines are recommended\n	 for children under 18.\nDo the COVID-19 vaccines affect fertility?\nNo. A myth circulating on social media claims that antibodies targeting\n	 the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus after vaccination or infection\n	 also target a protein that is involved in placenta formation called syncytin-1,\n	 leading to infertility in women. However, there is no evidence to support\n	 this and these proteins are not actually very similar. There were pregnancies\n	 that occurred in both the vaccine arm and placebo arm of the clinical\n	 trials of the COVID-19 vaccines without any imbalance between the groups,\n	 and no one who received the vaccine in the trials has had a poor pregnancy\n	 outcome to date. In addition, if this claim was true, natural infection\n	 with COVID-19 would also lead to infertility since antibodies against\n	 the spike protein are produced after an infection as well.\nCan I take it if I’m pregnant or nursing my baby? \nThe vaccines have not been studied in pregnant or nursing mothers; however,\n	 they are expected to be safe. Both the CDC and American College of Obstetricians\n	 and Gynecologists recommend that people who are pregnant or nursing receive\n	 the vaccine if they choose. Consider discussing possible risks and benefits\n	 with your doctor.\nCan I get the vaccine if I have food or medication allergies? \nAllergic reactions to the vaccine are possible. Any person with a severe\n	 allergy to any part of the vaccine should not receive it. Since many people\n	 are not sure which part of a vaccine they are allergic to, CDC recommends\n	 caution if you have a severe allergy to any other vaccine or injectable\n	 therapy. You may still receive the COVID-19 vaccine if this is the case\n	 but may want to discuss with your doctor first. If you have an allergy\n	 to foods or other non-injectable drugs, the vaccine is safe to receive.\nCan I take the vaccine if I am allergic to eggs? \nYes. Eggs or egg-based ingredients are not used at any point in the production\n	 of the Pfizer vaccine. It is safe for people with allergies.\nCan I take the vaccination if I’m allergic to penicillin? \nYes. There are no ingredients in the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination that should\n	 cause issues in patients with penicillin allergies. The CDC recommends\n	 patients with severe allergies get monitored for 15 to 30 minutes after\n	 receiving the vaccine as a precaution.\nIs the vaccine safe for people with compromised immune systems? \nYes. The vaccine has not been studied in immunocompromised people yet;\n	 however, there is no reason to expect it to be less safe in this population\n	 than in the general population. The CDC recommends that immunocompromised\n	 people receive the vaccine if they choose. Because vaccines are often\n	 less effective in immunocompromised patients, it is especially important\n	 for those who are immunocompromised to continue following distancing and\n	 masking recommendations even after they are vaccinated.\nDo I need to wear a mask when I receive the COVID-19 vaccine? \n\n	Yes. CDC recommends that during the pandemic people\n	wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth when in contact with others outside your\n	 household, when in healthcare facilities and when receiving any vaccine,\n	 including a COVID-19 vaccine. Anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable\n	 to remove a mask without assistance should not wear a mask.\n\nWhere can I find more information about the COVID-19 vaccine? \n\n	Please visit\n	cdc.gov/coronavirus.','No content','95370','1000 Greenley Rd Sonora, CA',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 00:02:02','2021-02-28 00:02:02','Adventist Health Sonora','CA','div|content-style'),(423,4,'https://www.bartonhealth.org/tahoe/vaccination-rollout-and-distribution.aspx','No content','No content','96150','2170 South Ave South Lake Tahoe, CA',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 00:07:56','2021-02-28 00:07:56','Barton Memorial Hospital','CA','div|cphBody_divBottom'),(424,42,'https://www.legacycommunityhealth.org/newsblog-novel-coronavirus-what-you-need-to-know/','COVID-19: What You Need to Know\n\n\n\nThe current CDC criteria we are using to determine eligibility is based on CDC guidelines and 1B of the Texas Department of State Health Services Allocation Plan that makes the COVID-19 vaccine available to:\n\nPatients older than 65\nPatients ages 18-65 with medical conditions that put them at a greater risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19\n\nIf you meet the above criteria, please proceed to schedule below.\nIf you have a scheduled appointment for a vaccine – IF you do not show up, you may be affecting others who have signed up for that shift and lead to a cancellation.

However, some people are at higher risk than others and more likely to become severely ill. Those at higher risks may require hospitalization, intensive care, a ventilator, or the virus could kill them. Based on a detailed review of available evidence to date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated and expanded the list of who is at an increased risk for becoming severely ill from COVID-19.\nWhile older adults (ages 65+) and people with underlying medical conditions remain at an increased risk for severe illness, the CDC has now further defined age and condition related risks. The CDC has removed the specific age threshold from the older adult classification and now warns that among adults, risk increases steadily as you age, and it’s not just those over the age of 65 who are at increased risk for severe illness. The CDC also updated the list of underlying medical conditions that increase risk of severe illness after reviewing published reports, pre-print studies, and various other data sources.\nPeople of any age with the following conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:\n\nChronic kidney disease\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\nObesity (BMI of 30 or higher)\nImmunocompromised state from solid organ transplant\nSerious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies\nSickle cell disease\nType 2 diabetes\n\nThe CDC also clarified the list of other conditions that might increase a person’s risk of severe illness:\n\nAsthma (moderate-to-severe)\nCerebrovascular disease\nCystic fibrosis\nHypertension\nImmunocompromised state from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines\nNeurologic conditions, such as dementia\nLiver disease\nPregnancy\nPulmonary fibrosis\nSmoking\nThalassemia\nType 1 diabetes mellitus\n\nThese changes increase the number of people who fall into higher risk groups. An estimated 60 percent of American adults have at least one chronic medical condition. Obesity is one of the most common underlying conditions that increases one’s risk for severe illness, with about 40 percent of U.S. adults having obesity. The more underlying medical conditions people have, the higher their risk.\nProtecting yourself, your family, and your community\nUnfortunately, every activity that involves contact with others has some degree of risk. It is important to know if you are at an increased risk for severe illness and understand the risks associated with different activities. This information is especially critical as communities across the state continue to reopen.\nAs always, everyone should continue to do their part to implement prevention strategies, such as participating in activities where social distancing can be maintained, washing hands frequently, limiting contact with and disinfecting commonly touched surfaces or shared items and wearing a cloth face covering when around non-household members, especially when it is difficult to stay 6 feet apart or when indoors. By taking these steps, you can help protect yourself, your loved ones, and others around you, including those most vulnerable to severe illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is Legacy doing to ensure the health and safety of patients and staff?\nCan I get my medications delivered to me for free?\nWhat we know about COVID-19\nHow is COVID-19 spread?\nWhat can you do to lower the chances of getting COVID-19?\nHow do I know if I need to self-quarantine?\nWhat to do if you think you may have COVID-19\nHow is COVID-19 diagnosed and who should be tested?\nWhat is the cash price of a COVID-19 diagnostic test?\nWhat happens if I am diagnosed with COVID-19?\nSafely leaving the house\nWhen to seek emergency medical attention if I have COVID-19\n\nWe know there is nothing more important to you than you and your family’s health. It is important to us too. That’s why as a leading provider of health care in our communities, Legacy is continuing to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and taking extra steps within our clinics to help ensure the health and safety of our community, patients and staff.\nSome of these extra steps include temporary measures such as:\n\nScreening all patients and staff for symptoms at the entrance of each clinic\nSending all patients and staff with symptoms to a testing location\nRequiring staff and all patients and visitors 2 years of age and older to wear face masks or cloth face coverings within the clinics and exam rooms.

MERS killed about a third (33%) of those infected, while SARS resulted in the deaths of about one-tenth (10%) of those infected. The mortality rate from the Novel Coronavirus is hanging steady at roughly 3% of those infected, however – patients who have died were over 60 years old, had other comorbidities, and weren’t admitted to a hospital until their illness was already at an advanced stage. For comparison, the CDC estimates that the current percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza is 6.9%. The situation is not dire or cause for a panic. There is no vaccine for this new strain of virus, but the symptoms are not thought to be deadly if treated early.\n\n\nThe virus is thought to spread mainly between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is believed people are most contagious when they are the sickest.\nSome spread may be possible before people have symptoms and by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes, but these are not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\nShould I be worried about my family or me contracting COVID-19?\nWhile the situation is evolving, if you are not in an area where the coronavirus is spreading, have not traveled to or from one of those areas or been on a cruise, or have not been in close contact with someone who has or may have the virus, you are currently at low risk for contracting the virus. Older people and people with severe underlying health conditions (e.g., heart disease, lung disease and diabetes), seem to be at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.\n\n\nThere is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to lower the chance of spreading and contracting the virus are:\n\nWash your hands frequently with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60%-95% alcohol.\nCover your mouth with tissues when you cough and sneeze, then throw used tissues in the trash.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.\nIf possible, stay home when you are sick with respiratory disease symptoms (symptoms listed below).\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick, especially with respiratory disease symptoms.\nAvoid travel to areas of high risk. You can view the CDC’s latest advisory list map here.\n\nIf you have questions about coronavirus, visit the CDC’s Novel Coronavirus 2020 website or contact your health care provider. You may also visit Harris Health.\n\n\nPeople who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19—excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months.\nPeople who have tested positive for COVID-19 do not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to 3 months as long as they do not develop symptoms again. People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.\nWhat counts as close contact?\n\nYou were within 6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more\nYou provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19\nYou had direct physical contact with the person (hugged or kissed them)\nYou shared eating or drinking utensils\nThey sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you\n\nSteps to Take: Stay home and monitor your health\n\nStay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19\nWatch for fever (100.4°F), cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19\nIf possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19\n\n\n\nThe CDC recommends the following if you are sick with COVID-19 or suspect you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 to help prevent the disease from spreading to people in your home and community:\n\nStay home: People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 should stay home, except for getting medical care.\nAvoid public areas.\nAvoid public transportation and ride sharing.\nSeparate yourself from other people and animals in your home.\nCall ahead before visiting your doctor and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help them take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.\nFollow the steps above (What can you do to lower the chances of getting COVID-19) to prevent the spread.\n\n\n\nA test kit has been developed for COVID-19. Legacy Community Health is following public health guidelines include looking at a patient’s symptoms, travel history and potential exposure, to determine which patients should be tested.\nWho should be tested for COVID-19?\nDiagnostic testing is being provided to patients based on guidance provided by the CDC, which includes the evaluation of the presence of symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath), travel history, contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, local risk of the disease, and should rule out other potential causes of illness. Legacy is closely following guidance from the CDC and will update this criteria as needed. For details on the CDC’s testing criteria, click here.\n\n\nLegacy accepts most HMOs/PPOs, Medicaid, CHIP and Medicare.  The cash price of a COVID-19 diagnostic test is $80 for self-pay patients (without HMO/PPO, Medicare, Medicaid and/or CHIP coverage). Some patients may be eligible for a sliding scale fee that would reduce the $80 cash price.\n\n\nIf a patient is confirmed to have COVID-19, their symptoms and health are evaluated to determine if they should be hospitalized or self-quarantined at home.\n\n\nAs the Houston economy begins to reopen and more and more of our favorite businesses and public spaces welcome us back, there are ways that we can support them without putting ourselves or our friends and neighbors at risk.We understand that this time of social distancing, mask wearing, and abundant caution has many people stressed and anxious.\nHowever, the world will not go back to normal without the cooperation of our communities to control the COVID-19 pandemic. The better we are all able to continue abiding by CDC guidelines, the quicker and more efficiently we can return to a safe way to go about our daily lives.\nMasks and Facial Coverings: It is still suggested that you wear a mask and/or facial covering if you are in public, with certain exemptions (such as if you are exercising, eating or drinking, or if you are socially distanced from others while outdoors).\nMasks remain important for public health because some people may be carrying the virus and not know it. This is called being asymptomatic. It means that you have the virus, but you do not have any symptoms. If you are asymptomatic, you are still contagious.\nMasks are not necessarily meant to protect you from other people (unless you are wearing an N95 mask), but to protect other people from you. Again – you could be asymptomatic and not know it. The way that masks work is that they catch the tiny droplets that come from your nose and mouth while you breathe, talk, cough, and sneeze. Those droplets can carry the virus and spread it to others. If everyone wears a mask, the virus can remain contained.\nWith the economy reopening, there are ways to safely attend your appointments, run your errands, and even enjoy a night out while also maintaining social distance and awareness of your health. If you are planning to visit the doctor’s office, get a haircut, go grocery shopping, or any number of other public activities that we have all so sorely missed these last few months, please remember the following:\n\nWear a mask or facial covering.\nKeep your distance from others, especially if you are indoors.\nIf you are using communal equipment, like at the gym for example, sanitize your hands and the equipment before and after use.\nAlways be sure to wash your produce before consumption.\nOn a bus or metro train, use your elbow rather than your hand to grip the bar if you are standing.\n\n\n\nLook for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:\n\n\n\nTrouble breathing\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest\nNew confusion\nInability to wake or stay awake\nBluish lips or face\n\n\n\n*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.\nCall 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful Blog Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nManaging Mental Health as We Remain at Home\n\n\n\n\n\n12\nJan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAt-Home HIV Testing Available Through Legacy\n\n\n\n\n\n16\nNov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nObserving World Diabetes Day during the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n13\nNov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIntimate Partner Violence during the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n14\nOct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHow to help your child feel more comfortable wearing a face mask\n\n\n\n\n\n26\nMay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIs it safe to immunize my baby during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n\n\n\n\n27\nApr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHelping our children navigate the COVID-19 crisis\n\n\n\n\n\n16\nApr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFeeding your baby during COVID-19 infant formula shortages\n\n\n\n\n\n13\nApr','No content','77006','1415 California St, Houston, TX 77006, Estados Unidos',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 00:11:36','2021-02-28 02:00:49','Legacy Community Health - Montrose Clinic','TX','div|content-area page-wrapper'),(425,4,'https://www.orovillehospital.com/news-media/news-article?&news=338','No content','No content','95966','2767 Olive Hwy Oroville, CA',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 00:22:26','2021-02-28 00:22:26','Oroville Hospital','CA','div|ctl00_cphContent_ctl01_updNews'),(426,4,'https://paradisemedicalgroup.com/coronavirus-update/','No content','No content','95969','6460 Pentz Rd Ste A Paradise, CA',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 00:28:04','2021-02-28 00:28:04','Paradise Medical Group','CA','div|wpb_wrapper'),(427,4,'http://www.pdh.org/alerts/coronavirus-covid-19-preparations','No content','No content','95971','1065 Bucks Lake Rd Quincy, CA',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 00:33:56','2021-02-28 00:33:56','Plumas District Hospital','CA','div|inner-content'),(428,4,'https://www.plumascounty.us/2761/COVID-19-Vaccine','HomeCOVID-19Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)COVID-19 Vaccine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 VACCINELAST UPDATED: Thursday, February 25, 2021, at 3:00 PM\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nAllocations received to date:Approximate # currently vaccinated through 2/27/21:Approximate # of vaccinations planned for through 3/5/21:% of Residents Vaccinated:Moderna -3,800 dosesPfizer -195 dosesBorrowed - 200 Moderna doses2,755600 first doses*administering 2nd doses as well. 14.5%Information will be updated at least weekly by Friday at 5 PM - last updated Thursday, 2/25/21 at 3:00 PM\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 VACCINE INFORMATION PORTALPlease note: A valid e-mail address OR phone number is required to provide information and get notified.

Approving vaccines as safe, and making sure they work, is up to several scientific groups at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and other groups look at available information about a vaccine and make informed decisions about the risks and benefits of using it.On December 11, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) for a vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older. The emergency use authorization allows the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S.On December 18, 2020, the FDA issued the second EUA for a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.

After the vaccine’s safety has been reviewed and approved by these health experts, the State is planning to distribute and administer vaccines as quickly as possible.California’s distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will be guided by the following overarching principles:The vaccine meets safety requirementsThe vaccine is distributed and administered equitably. People with the highest risk of infection will get the vaccine first.Community stakeholders (at the State level) are brought in from the outset for transparencyA safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine will be one of the most important tools to end the COVID-19 pandemic. California will be transparent, careful, and above all, equitable in its vaccine distribution. The state will provide a COVID-19 vaccine to everyone in California who needs and requests vaccination as supplies are available.For more information, seeCDPH’s COVID-19 vaccine planningCDC’s Vaccine Information for You & Your Family\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nWhy we need a vaccineGetting vaccinated against COVID-19 will be one of the best ways to protect yourself and everyone around you. If you are protected from getting COVID-19, you cannot pass the disease to others.Because the supply of vaccine will be limited at first, doing other things to help stop the spread will be just as important as it is now.

As in any hospital, there are many infection control and management measures in place at all times. We manage infectious disease every day in the hospital. We are here to care for everyone and to make sure everyone gets excellent care. \nPlease plan to keep all existing appointments unless Orchard Hospital or the Medical Specialty Center contacts you directly to reschedule. Our top priority is to provide safe, high-quality care for our patients.\nWhat are the symptoms of novel coronavirus?\nNovel coronavirus symptoms include fever, dry coughs or the shortness of breath associated with respiratory illness, and other flu-like symptoms. Sinus congestion or pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea are unlikely to be associated with COVID-19.\nCall your primary care provider if you experience symptoms and believe you have been in close contact with a person known to have novel coronavirus.\nHow do I know if I need medical attention?\nJust like any other medical condition, there are times when you need to see your primary care provider and times when you need to seek hospital-level care. Most of those same conditions apply to COVID-19.\nIf you need to go to the hospital because you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or get to a hospital immediately. If you have symptoms that are difficult to manage, but not that serious, call your primary care provider or seek urgent care.\nIf you have symptoms that seem like a common cold, but arenât that serious, isolate yourself, treat it at home, and try not to share the infection with others.\n\nChanges to Visitor Policy (effective until April 30, 2020):\n\nAt Orchard Hospital we are working together to protect our patients, staff, and you. As the number of cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) grow in the State of California it is critical to minimize avoidable exposure to COVID-19 whenever possible. Because some individuals who contract the COVID-19 virus have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, which means they may not be aware they are carrying the virus; visitors will not be allowed in the hospital, clinics and other outpatient locations.\nExceptions to this policy include visitors supporting those patients:\n\nUnder the age of 18,\nExperiencing urgent legal issues,\nWith developmental or physical disabilities preventing them from navigating the appointment or facility alone, or\nRequiring a caregiver to support the patientâs ability to understand or participate in the care or treatment.\n\nThose visitors admitted must follow all required precautions to prevent patients and staff from exposure, including:\n\nCompletion of a COVID-19 screening,\nMaintaining 6 feet distance from others,\nPerforming hand hygiene as ordered,\nFollowing the directions of hospital staff, and keeping the visit as short as possible.\n\nOn behalf of our staff and patients, we thank you for your understanding and compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients & VisitorsCMS Price TransparencyNovel Coronavirus (COVID-19)Crisis Care Continuum GuidelinesFinancial AssistanceHIPAA Privacy NoticeLanguage Line ServicesOnline Bill PayPatient Portal InformationQuality and SafetyQuality Transparency DashboardRights and ResponsibilitiesSacValley MedShareWhat to Expect','No content','95948','240 Spruce St Gridley, CA',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 01:05:48','2021-02-28 01:05:48','Orchard Hospital','CA','div|container_12 clearfix'),(430,4,'https://senecahospital.org/covid/','COVID-19 InformationPCPHA  COVID-19 VACCINE INFORMATION PORTALAll information we are providing on our website regarding COVID-19 is coming directly from Plumas County Public Health or CDC.

When we receive vaccine from the state, we open our website for people in the community to register. Vaccine is currently available only for those in Phase 1A and Phase 1B according to State of Texas guidelines. Because we are limited by vaccine supply, the open spots are typically filled within hours. As we get more vaccine, we often are able to invite those who have already filled out the form but didnt receive an invitation (thereby on the \"waitlist\"), as well as reopen registration.\n \nOur goal is to continue our outreach to the hardest hit neighborhoods in our city and our most vulnerable patients, as well as keep vaccinating our employees, physicians and first responders. These groups do not need to sign up through the hub, but will be contacted instead by Houston Methodist.\n \nIf you have accessed a Houston Methodist doctor or service in the past two years, please do not use the hub to sign up for a vaccine. Instead, we will contact you by text, email or phone when we reach your vaccine priority group, based on the criteria listed below.\n\n \nImportant COVID-19 patient vaccine plan\nHouston Methodist is also offering the vaccine to at-risk, vulnerable patients who meet specific criteria. \n \nWe are currently notifying eligible patients via automated phone call, text message, email or regular mail to schedule their vaccine:          \n\n1. Patients 65 and older\n2. Patients 55 to 64 who have at least one Class 1* comorbid condition, or at least two Class 2* comorbid conditions\n \n*Class 1 conditions include: cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac conditions (congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy), obesity (BMI 30+), pregnancy, sickle cell disease, smoking, solid organ transplant, Type I or II diabetes mellitus\n**Class 2 conditions include: asthma, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents\n \nProof of Vaccine: After you receive your initial and booster doses of the vaccine, it will be recorded in MyChart. If you do not have a MyChart account, you can register as a new user here.\n \nYou do NOT need an authentication code to sign up. You can access MyChart without a code by clicking on “No Authentication Code?” on the screen. \nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nWhat is the vaccine hub?\nThe state included Houston Methodist in its program to vaccinate a large number of our city’s most vulnerable members. As such, when we receive vaccine from the state, we open our website for people in the community who meet current eligibility guidelines to register. Vaccine is currently available only for those in Phase 1A and Phase 1B according to State of Texas guidelines. Because we are limited by vaccine supply, the open spots are typically filled within hours. Our goal is to continue our outreach to the hardest hit neighborhoods in our city and our most vulnerable patients, as well as keep vaccinating our employees, physicians and first responders. \nWhat happens if I filled out the vaccine hub form but I didnt get an appointment?\nUnfortunately, we cannot immediately  accommodate everyone who fills out the form due to the limited supply of the vaccine. As we get more vaccine, we often are able to invite those on the waitlist, as well as reopen registration. \nI heard the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer vaccine? What does that mean?\nThe FDA issued an EUA for the Pfizer vaccine on Friday, Dec. 11. In an emergency, like a pandemic, the FDA can make a judgment that it’s worth releasing something for use even without the typical timeline for a new vaccine or drug. According to a press release issued by the FDA, the FDA determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information.\nIs it safe?\nBefore the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization, the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was reviewed by panels of independent experts retained by the companies; by FDA scientific staff; and by an independent panel of experts convened by the FDA. There are no reported serious safety concerns from this vaccine. The CDC and the FDA will continue to monitor individuals who have received the vaccine to ensure there’s no evidence of even rare safety issues.\n \nPlease also keep in mind that COVID-19 can be a fatal or debilitating disease, even in young healthy people. The risks from contracting the virus are greater than the possible risks from receiving the vaccine.\nCan I get COVID-19 from the vaccine?\nNo. It is not possible to get COVID-19 from vaccines. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use only a gene from the virus while other vaccines being studied use inactivated virus. None of these can cause COVID-19.\nAre the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna basically the same?\nWhile both are mRNA vaccines, there are several differences between the two: \n\nThe two vaccines have different age requirements. You must be at least 18 years old to receive the Moderna vaccine and at least 16 years old to receive the Pfizer vaccine. \nThe waiting period between the two vaccines is different. You must wait 21 days between your first and second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and 28 days between doses for the Moderna vaccine.\nThe Pfizer vaccine requires a much colder storage than the Moderna vaccine. \n \n\n \nFor questions specific to the Pfizer vaccine click here, and for questions specific to the Moderna vaccine click here.\nWhich vaccine is better between Pfizer and Moderna?\nBoth vaccines have shown to be very effective at preventing COVID-19 infection. The Pfizer vaccine has shown to be 95% effective across all age, racial and ethnic groups. The Moderna vaccine has shown to be 94.1% effective across all racial and ethnic groups, but this number did appear to be a little lower among those 65 years of age or older.\nNow that the Moderna vaccine has received EUA from the FDA, will I be able to choose between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine?\nNo. Supplies are still too limited to allow you to choose between the two vaccines. You will be given the vaccine that we have available at the time you are vaccinated.\nAre the vaccines interchangeable? If I get the Pfizer dose first, can I get the Moderna dose second?\nNo. You must receive the related second dose for the vaccine to work appropriately. You cannot interchange the two vaccines as they are not exactly the same.\nWhat if I am concerned about my side effects from any of the vaccines?\nPlease seek medical attention immediately by calling your doctor’s office or setting up a virtual visit if you experience severe side effects.  \nShould I wait to get a vaccine until all of the vaccines are approved, and can I pick which one I want?\nClinical trials indicate that the Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective and the Moderna vaccine is 94% effective, both with minimal side effects, so we recommend that you get the vaccine as soon as it is offered to you to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are effective, and we would not recommend one over the other or waiting until other vaccines currently in the pipeline have been approved. There are also no guarantees that any of the other vaccines will be made available to us in the near future. We advise you to take the vaccine that’s made available to you and not to wait.\nI have a health condition that prevents me from getting vaccines with live viruses. Do you know if the COVID-19 vaccine uses a live virus?\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines are mRNA vaccines, and AstraZeneca’s and Johnson & Johnson’s are non-replicating vectored vaccines. None of the early vaccines being tested are live weakened versions of the virus. When vaccines are licensed, part of the information that will be provided will include who should or should not get each vaccine. We recommend talking with your health care provider to determine which vaccine will be the best one for you, given your medical history.\nIf I have had COVID-19 should I get the vaccine?\nYes. COVID-19 infection does induce immunity, but it induces less of an antibody response than the vaccine. The antibody response to the vaccine is dramatically higher than it is to natural infection. We are seeing reinfection among people who have already been infected with COVID-19, so the vaccine should provide additional protection against reinfection. \nWill the vaccine be given annually like the flu shot?\nWe are studying this now and we don’t think this will be an annual vaccine, but we are not sure yet. We will let you know as soon we know. \nDo I have to continue wearing a mask after I get the vaccine?\nYes. We should continue wearing masks, practicing excellent hand hygiene and social distancing until enough vaccine is manufactured and distributed, until we know how long a vaccine will protect us, and until our community shows levels of minimal spread. \nWhat risks should I consider if I’m pregnant and trying to decide if I should get the vaccine?\nYou should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission; your personal risk of contracting COVID-19; the risks of COVID-19 to you and potential risks to the fetus; the efficacy of the vaccine; the known side effects of the vaccine; and the lack of data about the vaccine during pregnancy. We recommend that you reach out to your health care provider to help you make an informed decision. \nShould I get the vaccine if I’m breastfeeding?\nThere is no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in lactating women or the effects of mRNA vaccines on the breastfed infant or milk production. According to the CDC, mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant. If a lactating woman is part of a group that is recommended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, she may choose to be vaccinated. We recommend that you reach out to your health care provider to help you make an informed decision. \nIf I get sick after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, should I still get the second shot?\nUnless you develop a contraindication to the vaccination, you should complete the series even if you develop the expected post-vaccination symptoms in order to optimize protection against COVID-19, according to the CDC. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose\nHow long will it take for the vaccine to begin protecting me?\nAccording to the CDC, it will take approximately one to two weeks following the second dose to be considered fully vaccinated.\nShould I get the vaccine if I’ve had a severe allergic reaction to vaccines in the past?\nNo. People who have had a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine should not receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at this time.\nWill I be monitored for any side effects after I receive the vaccine?\nYes. Vaccine providers will observe patients after administering the vaccination to monitor for immediate adverse reactions. People with a history of anaphylaxis will be monitored for 30 minutes, and everyone else receiving the vaccine will be monitored for side effects for 15 minutes.\nShould I get the vaccine if I am immunocompromised?\nThere is currently not enough data available to establish the vaccine’s safety and efficacy for immunocompromised people. People with HIV infection, other immunocompromising conditions, or people who take immunosuppressive medications or therapies might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. These individuals may still receive the COVID-19 vaccine unless otherwise contraindicated. We recommend that you reach out to your health care provider to help you make an informed decision. \nWhat risks should I consider if I’m immunocompromised? \nAccording to the CDC, you should consider the unknown vaccine safety and efficacy profiles in immunocompromised people, the potential for reduced immune responses, and the risks of becoming ill with COVID-19, as well as the need to continue to follow all current guidance to protect yourself against COVID-19.\nCan a person already sick with COVID-19 receive the vaccine?\nThe vaccination should be deferred until the person recovers from an acute illness (if the person had symptoms) and has met the criteria to discontinue isolation. As soon as your acute symptoms resolve you can be vaccinated.\nShould people who previously received antibody therapy for COVID-19 receive the vaccine?\nThere is no data on the safety or efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccination in people who received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment. According to the CDC, the vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days to avoid interference of the treatment with \nvaccine-induced immune responses.\nShould people with underlying medical conditions receive the vaccine?\nYes. The vaccine may be administered to people with underlying medical conditions who have no contraindications to vaccination. Phase II and phase III clinical trials demonstrated similar safety and efficacy profiles in people with underlying medical conditions, including those that place them at increased risk for severe COVID-19, compared to people without comorbidities.\nShould I take Tylenol or Advil before the vaccine to minimize my possible side effects?\nNo, it is not recommended at this time due to a lack of information on the impact of use on vaccine-induced antibody responses. Antipyretic or analgesic may be taken for treatment of post-vaccination symptoms.\nGETTING THE VACCINE FROM HOUSTON METHODIST\nWhen will Houston Methodist receive the COVID-19 vaccine?\nWe began administering the vaccine to our first group of employees on Dec. 15. \nIf family members of patients admitted at Houston Methodist hospitals can prove they received the COVID-19 vaccine, will they be allowed to visit a Houston Methodist patient?\nNo. The vaccine is not 100% effective, and we must do everything we can to protect our patients, including enforcing a strict visitor policy. \nIs there a government registrar for those who receive the vaccine, and if so, what information will the government require from Houston Methodist? \nYes, vaccine providers are required to provide certain data elements for every dose administered within 24 hours of administering it to the state’s vaccine registry. This is the same vaccine registry that we report our current vaccines to, such as Hepatitis B, and the security of that data complies with federal and state laws governing confidentiality and privacy. \nI got a text message, email or phone call notice that I was eligible for the vaccine, but my significant other or child didn’t. Why?\nThere are not enough vaccines for everyone right now. To be fair in the distribution of vaccines, we developed a tiered system; the patients and community members who are most in need and could benefit the most from the vaccine have the opportunity to receive it first.\nTo create this tiered approach, we used guidelines from the National Academy of Medicine, the State governor, the CDC and Health and Human Services, and published studies. We will expand the pool of eligible patients and community members who can receive the vaccine as soon as more vaccines become available.\nWhat signs should I be concerned about? When should I call a primary care physician (PCP)?\nCall your primary care physician if you experience:\n\nLightheadedness\nDizziness and/or weakness \nA rash on your body \nSwelling of your face and/or throat\nFever between 99.5-101 degrees Fahrenheit\nSore throat, congestion or runny nose\nChills\n \n\n \nCall 911 or go to the nearest Emergency Department if you experience:\n\nWorsening, severe difficulty breathing, or unusually fast heartbeat\nTrouble waking (or becoming confused in a way that’s new)\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest\n\nI’d like to make an appointment with a primary care physician. How do I find one and make an appointment?\nTo identify a primary care physician or if you have any questions, please click here or call us at 346.803.2915. Or, if you prefer, you can schedule a virtual appointment here from the comfort of your home.\nDoes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Food & Drug Administration monitor my health in any way?\nYes. V-safe is smartphone-based app tool that uses text messages and web surveys where you can quickly tell the CDC if you experience any side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine. Click here for more details on downloading their app. \nWhere do I find proof of my vaccine?\nAfter you receive your initial and booster doses of the vaccine, it will be recorded in MyChart. If you do not have a MyChart account, you can register as a new user here.\nYou do NOT need an authentication code to sign up. You can access MyChart without a code by clicking on “No Authentication Code?” on the screen.\n For assistance, please call us at 832.667.5694, Monday-Friday from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m.\nGENERAL VACCINE QUESTIONS \nWhat is a vaccine?\nAccording to the CDC, a vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies and cellular immunity to combat that specific disease, like it would if you were actually exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease without having to get the disease first. This is why vaccines are necessary — they prevent disease by letting you develop immunity in a safe and controlled way.\nHow does the vaccine for COVID-19 work?\nPfizer and Moderna’s vaccines use novel messenger-RNA, or mRNA, technology, which uses genetic material to cause the body to create a protein from the virus, allowing the immune system to recognize the virus and attack it. These will be the first mRNA products to be approved by the FDA. The studies have enrolled 43,538 volunteers and 38,955 have received their second dose. About 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. In Pfizer and BioNTech’s late-stage clinical trial, 50% of the volunteers got the vaccine, while the other half got a placebo of saltwater. Then they waited to see who would get sick. Only 170 volunteers out of 44,000 have so far gotten sick with COVID-19. An independent board of experts looked at the placebo group and vaccine participants and reported that the vaccine is 95% effective. See this story to learn more about mRNA vaccines. And this story from Time Magazine gives a great overview. See this infographic for a quick study on how the mRNA vaccine works.\nAre there other vaccines being studied?\nThe AstraZeneca and University of Oxford team, as well as Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, are also working on vaccines but using different technology for delivering the viral genes that can produce viral proteins to activate the immune system. Novavax and the Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline are working on a vaccine that uses proteins themselves to trigger an immune response. All are close to completing their testing. For up-to-date information on all the vaccines, please see testing of their shots. To track the vaccine trials, please see this updated tracker in the New York Times.\nWill the vaccine keep me from getting COVID-19?\nCurrent data show that both the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna vaccine are 95% effective in preventing a person from getting COVID-19. The studies did not test everyone to see how many people in the vaccinated group got infected compared with the placebo group. Instead, the scientists compared how many in the vaccinated group and the placebo group went on to develop disease. The companies will continue to test people in the studies for antibodies to the COVID-19 virus, which would include people who did not show any symptoms of their infection, so they can get a better sense of whether or not the vaccines protect against not only getting sick, but also against infection.\nAre there challenges with the distribution?\nThese vaccines will require two doses and need to be kept at very low temperatures, much colder than a household freezer. Many hospitals and clinics do not have the ability to store the medicine at these ultra-low temperatures, so that must be worked out. At Houston Methodist, we have ample cold storage facilities to hold whichever vaccine we use for patients and employees. And during distribution we still need to keep the vaccines cold and the temperature strictly monitored, making the distributing challenging. However, Houston Methodist has teams working on our plans for this and we are prepared to store and safely distribute the vaccine we receive. \nI’m concerned that this “experimental” vaccine is being rushed. Is the FDA overseeing this?\nYes, it is. The FDA is expediting clinical trials for vaccines because of the importance to stop the spread of COVID-19. However, the FDA is following its processes and only issued the EUA for the Pfizer vaccine after it determined it safe and that the manufacturer conducted the trials properly. Remember that safety is paramount at Houston Methodist – for both our patients and our staff. We are hopeful that the vaccine will help keep you, your family and our patients safe by keeping you healthy. \nWill getting the flu vaccine protect me from COVID-19?\nA flu vaccine will not protect you from getting COVID-19, but it can prevent you from getting influenza (flu) at the same time as COVID-19. This can keep you from experiencing a more severe illness. While it’s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the winter, CDC believes it’s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes COVID-19 will both spread during that time. You should encourage all of your friends and family to get flu shots, just like we have at Houston Methodist.\nWill COVID-19 vaccines cause me to test positive on COVID-19 viral tests?\nNo. These vaccines will not cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection. As your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, it is likely you will test positive on some antibody tests. Antibody tests currently indicate you had a previous infection or vaccination and that you may have some level of protection against the virus. Experts are currently studying how COVID-19 vaccination will affect antibody testing results and whether performing these tests are useful in determining an individual’s immune status to COVID-19.\nWhat are the odds I’ll still catch COVID-19?\nAccording to the CDC, we won’t know how long immunity lasts until we have a vaccine and more data on how well it works. Both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are trying to learn more about. The CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.\nDo the new vaccine trial results mean the end to the pandemic?\nIn the short term, no. The soonest that coronavirus vaccines could become widely available to the public would be in the spring. But if effective vaccines become available — and if most people get them — the pandemic could drastically shrink. This means we are one giant step closer to getting our lives back \nto normal. \nWill people who have gotten sick with COVID-19 still benefit from getting vaccinated?\nDue to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID-19 is possible, people may be advised to get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID-19 previously. At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called natural immunity, varies from person to person and the evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long in some people.\nYou can download a PDF of these frequently asked questions here.\nLearn More About COVID-19 Vaccines\nRead our latest On Health blog articles on the COVID-19 vaccine:\n\nHerd Immunity: How Many People Need to Get the COVID-19 Vaccine?\nHow Was the COVID-19 Vaccine Developed So Fast?\nCOVID-19 Vaccines: What About Side Effects?\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Distribution: Rehearsing Our Rollout Plan\nHeres What We Know About COVID-19 Vaccine Safety\nWhen Can You Expect the COVID-19 Vaccine to Be Available to You?\nDistributing the COVID-19 Vaccine: An Inside Look at Our Planning Process\nHow mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Work\nWhy the COVID-19 Vaccine Needs to Be Kept So Cold (& What This Means for Its Availability)\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Q&A: Your Questions, Expert Answers\n\n \nOther Helpful Resources\nLearn all about COVID-19 vaccines in development and vaccination planning in the United States and in Texas:\n\nCDC General COVID-19 Vaccine Information\nFDA COVID-19 Vaccine Information\nTexas COVID-19 Vaccination Plan\nDSHS Immunizations Unit: COVID-19 Vaccine Information\nPfizer Coronavirus Vaccine\nModerna COVID-19 Vaccine','No content','77030','6565 Fannin St, Houston, TX 77030, Estados Unidos',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 04:52:09','2021-02-28 05:05:00','Houston Methodist Hospital','TX','div|img-wrapTxt col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 WithLine'),(441,42,'https://www.sjmctx.org/vaccine','St. Joseph Medical Center\nServices Directory\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Joseph’s Medical Center is continuing to administer the first round of vaccine to our frontline healthcare workers.

Patients who meet the CDC’s criteria for vaccination in the 1A or 1B categories will receive appointment notification via text, MKO, or phone call to schedule their COVID-19 first-dose vaccination.\n\n\nNEW! Join Kelsey-Seybold’s COVID-19 Vaccine Waitlist.  We are instituting a waitlist for patients who have not been vaccinated and would like to be notified when Kelsey-Seybold receives vaccine supply. Patients will continue to be eligible and contacted based on state and CDC criteria and risk (Phase 1A or 1B categories). Signing up on the waitlist does not guarantee nor confirm a vaccine appointment. Because vaccine supply is limited at this time, the waitlist will help expedite scheduling appointments to eligible patients who still need and want to be vaccinated. ​​\n\n\nSecond-Dose Appointment Updates: The inclement weather and widespread utility outages last week halted much of our in-person appointments for second doses of the vaccine. Patients who were scheduled to receive a second dose of vaccine last week should have received a notification via text message, MKO notification, or phone call regarding their rescheduled appointment. Many of these appointments will have been completed by week’s end. The second-dose vaccination is still effective and safe if administered beyond the CDC’s recommended 21-day (Pfizer) or 28-day (Moderna) wait period from the first dose. Patients who were unable to get vaccinated this week still have time to receive their second dose. \n      You can read the CDC’s vaccine FAQs here.\nReminder: If you are a current patient and receive(d) your first- or second-dose vaccine through another provider or community vaccination hub/center, please message your primary care doctor with this information via the “ask my doctor” messaging feature in your secure MyKelseyOnline account so your medical record can be updated in our system.\nAs vaccine is received, we will notify eligible patients by phone, text, and/or through their MyKelseyOnline account to schedule a vaccination appointment.\n\nTop Question of the Week:\n\nI have heard that the COVID-19 vaccination can impact the results of a screening mammograms and CT CHEST screening exams. I am due for a screening mammogram or a CT CHEST screening, but plan to or have taken a COVID-19 vaccine. What should I do?Vaccinations of any kind may cause lymph nodes to appear enlarged on imaging exams.  Lymph nodes are part of the immune system that play a vital role in your body’s ability to fight off infections and after vaccinations, lymph nodes may get larger as your immune system ramps up production of antibodies.To reduce the incidence of a false positive screening mammogram or CT CHEST result  – or the need for additional evaluation – we recommend that if you are due for a screening mammogram or screening CT CHEST now and have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine, please have your screening studies done before your vaccination. If you have already had the first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, you may wish to wait two months between the final dose of vaccine and the scheduling of screening studies  to minimize  the potential of false positive results.This recommendation \n            \ndoes not apply to patients with breast lumps or other breast conditions who need a diagnostic mammogram. Only patients without breast symptoms seeking to schedule a screening mammogram should consider this recommendation.Similarly, this recommendation \n            \ndoes not apply to patients who have CT CHEST scans ordered by their doctor for chest or respiratory related symptoms. Only patients scheduled for surveillance CT CHEST to screen for lung cancer should consider this recommendation.\n\n\n\n​​​​​​​​​​MyKelseyOnlineLearn more about the vaccine and sign up for available appointments.\nSchedule Now​  ​​​ \n\nCOVID-19 Resource CenterStay up to date with important information for You and Your Family.\n\nLearn More  ​​​ ​ \n\n​​​​​​​​​​​​Virtual & In-Person VisitsSearch and schedule next-day or future appointments for adults and children.\n\n​​​Make an Appointment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Resource CenterCOVID-19 Vaccine\nFAQsWeekly UpdatesCurrently selectedWaitlist RegistrationClinical Trials for KidsPatient Communication\nCOVID-19 InformationE-visits for COVID-19Video Visits for COVID-19About Asymptomatic TestingInformation for Pregnant PatientsLeadership AnnouncementsCareConnect ConvosVirtual Visit ResourcesPatient Info: Negative Test for COVID-19Take Care by Taking 5COVID-19 Symptoms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeftNav HTML\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppointmentsMake an Appointment Schedule OnlineAfter-Hours CareInsurance AcceptedPay Your Bill OnlineFind UsFind a DoctorFind a LocationFind a PharmacyMedical SpecialtiesInsurance Accepted\nServicesOur Medical SpecialtiesOur Medical ServicesCorporate WellnessExecutive HealthTravel MedicineAbout UsAbout Kelsey-SeyboldOur FounderOur HistoryCareersContact Us\n\nAffiliate Providers\nDerechos del Paciente\nEmployee Secure Web Access\nKelsey Research Foundation\nGuide to Clinics and Providers\nGuia de Clinicas y Proveedores\n\nPatient Financial Policy\nPatient Rights\nPrivacy PolicyRelease of Information\nUtilization Management Policy\n\n\nKelsey-Seybold Clinic\n24/7 Appointment Scheduling  713.442.0427Download the MyKelsey Scheduling App: © 2021 Kelsey-Seybold Clinic.

Samantha Counts, an RN in the Emergency Services department, became OMC’s first front-line health care worker to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\n“It’s been a very stressful year, and we’re all very tired,” Counts said. “We’re all ready to put this behind us.”\n\n \n\n\nPhased Approach to COVID-19 Vaccination\nUpdated Jan. 19, 2021 // Dates listed with each tier are estimates\nGovernor Inslee announced on Jan. 18 a state-wide plan for widespread vaccine distribution and administration, which included changing the age threshold for those eligible to receive the vaccine in Phase 1B, Tier 1. All individuals 65 years or older all now eligible for vaccination. However, vaccinations clinics in Clallam County are currently offering the vaccine to individuals 70 years or older, according to local supply of the vaccine.\nOn Jan. 6, the Washington State Department of Health announced an estimated timeline for vaccinations in Phase 1B, Tiers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Information on who is eligible for vaccination in Phases 2, 3 and 4 will be announced soon by the DOH. For more information, visit CovidVaccineWA.org.\nThe Washington State Department of Health released on Dec. 10 (and updated on Dec. 30) COVID-19 vaccine allocation guidance for Phase 1A, Tiers 1 and 2.\n\n \n\n\nPhase 1A\nTiers 1 & 2 // December 2020\n\nHigh-risk workers in health care settings\nHigh-risk first responders\nResidents and staff of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other community-based, congregate living settings where most individuals over 65 years of age are receiving care, supervision, or assistance\nAll other workers at risk in health care setting\n\n\n \n\n\nPhase 1B\nTier 1 // January 2021\n\nAll people 65 years or older (updated Jan. 18)\nAll people 50 years or older in multigenerational households\n\nThe Washington State Department of Health has defined individuals at risk due to living in multigenerational households as follows:\n\nVulnerability – specifically, an older adult or elder who cannot live independently and is being cared for by a relative or inhome caregiver or being cared for by someone who works outside the home.\nRisk of exposure – specifically, an older adult or elder who is living with and taking care of kinship (along the lines of a\ngrandparent with a grandchild)\nThis group does not include an older adult who is able to live independently and is taking care of the individual’s\nkinship/children.\n\n\n\n\n\nTier 2 // February 2021\n\nHigh-risk critical workers 50 years or older who work in certain congregate settings: agriculture; food processing; grocery stores; K-12 (teachers and school staff); childcare; corrections; prisons, jails or detention centers; public transit; fire; law enforcement\n\nTier 3 // March 2021\n\nPeople 16 years or older with 2 or more co-morbidities or underlying conditions\n\nTier 4 // April 2021\n\nHigh-risk critical workers under 50 years who work in congregate settings (as noted in Phase 1B, Tier 2)\nPeople, staff and volunteers in congregate living settings: Correctional facilities, group homes for people with disabilities; people experiencing homelessness that live in or access services in congregate settings\n\n\n \n\n\nAs noted by the Department of Health, this approach prioritizes population groups that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 due to external social factors and systemic inequities.\nEach group will become eligible for the vaccine one at a time and will continue to be eligible throughout the vaccine distribution.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFDA Approves Emergency Use Authorizations for Two Vaccines\nUpdated Dec. 21 \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved two emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines, first the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 11 and, most recently, the Moderna vaccine on Dec. 18.\nThe first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the state of Washington on Monday, Dec. 14. Olympic Medical Center expects to receive a distribution of 975 doses of the vaccine.\nOlympic Medical Center is prepared to administer approved vaccines according to the phased approach outlined in the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccination Program.\nEach potential COVID-19 vaccine undergoes thorough clinical trials before the FDA reviews test results and any side effects in order to determine that it is safe and effective. If approved by the FDA, each vaccine also undergoes additional review by a multi-state vaccine workgroup, the COVID Vaccine Safety Review Workgroup. Washington is a part of the workgroup, along with California, Oregon and Nevada.\n\n \n\n\nOMC Readiness for COVID-19 Vaccine\nOMC has purchased and installed an ultra-low temperature freezer, which will be necessary to store the vaccine. The freezer is one of two known ultra-low temperature freezers in Clallam County.\nOMC has started administering vaccines, beginning with front-line health care workers who are at the most risk of being exposed to COVID-19, including, but not limited to, those who work in the emergency department, inpatient units, Walk-in Clinic and the COVID-19 testing site.\nAs supply of approved vaccines become more readily available and the vaccination program continues through each phase, OMC will be prepared to administer vaccines to each group and population in Clallam County.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Are COVID-19 Vaccines Made?\nVaccine testing and production are being done simultaneously to expedite the process of realizing an authorized vaccine for the public. Multiple COVID vaccines are being tested.\nEach vaccine goes through multiple clinical trials, starting first with small group of volunteers before expanding to a few hundred and eventually a few thousand volunteers.\nAfter successfully advancing through clinical trials, each vaccine must be approved by the FDA.\n\n \n\n\nCDC: Ensuring the Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States | Ensuring COVID-19 Vaccines Work\n\n \n\n\nHow will COVID-19 vaccines work?\nFrom the Washington State Department of Health, “The COVID-19 vaccine teaches your immune system to recognize the coronavirus. When you get the vaccine, your immune system makes antibodies (‘fighter cells’) that stay in your blood and protect you in case you are infected with the virus. You get protection against the disease without having to get sick.”\nMost COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be administered in two doses, separated by either 21 or 28 days. COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers will not be interchangeable; individuals must receive their second dose from the same manufacturer as the first dose. At the time of receiving the first dose, individuals will receive a second-dose reminder card, detailing the date of their first dose, vaccine manufacturer, lot number and the due date of their second dose.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More About COVID-19 Vaccines\nLearn more about COVID-19 vaccines, how they are being made and tested, when they will be made available and how they will work.\n\n Washington State Department of HealthLEARN MORE \n\n\nCenters for Disease ControlLEARN MORE','No content','98362','928 Caroline St Port Angeles, WA',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 05:24:33','2021-02-28 05:24:33','Olympic Medical Center','WA','div|full_width_inner'),(459,31,'https://www.mountsinai.org/about/covid19/vaccine-information','Share\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\nAbout Us\nCOVID-19 Facts and Resources','No content','10025','1111 Amsterdam Avenue New York, NY 10025',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 05:25:13','2021-02-28 05:25:13','Mount Sinai Morningside','NY','div|full-width'),(460,31,'https://www.tbh.org/coronavirus','Practical Tips to Keep You and Your Family Safe\nHow to Help.

And we do that by keeping our spaces clean. That is our commitment to you.\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE — June 2020\nA Letter from Our President & CEO\nMoving Forward: A Hospital Within a Hospital\nWe hope you and your family are in good health. We have all been through a lot these last few months and are all looking forward to resuming more normal routines. While many things have changed, one thing remains constant: TBHC’s commitment to Keeping Brooklyn Healthy\nOur healthcare workers have heroically fought on the frontlines of the COVID-19 battle, and we remain here for those who continue to come in with COVID. But we also need to return to providing care for those patients getting a knee replaced, seeking relief for a painful spine debilitation, or considering life-preserving weight-loss surgery. We serve our community’s healthcare needs in a myriad of ways. As COVID-19 remains in the community until a vaccine is created, we know you have a multitude of questions about how TBHC will continue to deliver safe, effective and compassionate care. Let’s tackle those questions here:\nWhat do you mean by a hospital within a hospital?As soon as it is allowed by the State of New York, TBHC will phase in elective surgeries and procedures. Because TBHC continues to manage COVID-19 patients, the hospital has created a “COVID-safe” environment by organizing the hospital into separate areas with distinct access points, designated waiting areas, staff, nursing units and equipment. We will be effectively treating the needs of both sets of patients in separate and safe models of care.\nWhen is the hospital transitioning to this new model?TBHC is already performing a number of urgent and emergency surgeries and procedures following best practices around COVID screening and safety protocols. Full capacity for elective surgeries and procedures is anticipated for the near future.\nHow will the Emergency Room handle COVID safely?The Emergency Room will safely handle both COVID-19 and non-COVID cases in the following ways:\n\nEveryone, staff and patients alike, must wear masks. If you do not have one, you will be provided with one.\nWhen you arrive, you will be screened for possible COVID-19 or other contagious illness.\nIf it is determined your condition is not related to a contagious illness:\n\nYou will be directed to our waiting area, which will only allow patients with non-contagious illness. There, you will be asked to observe social distancing according to marks on the floor or staff direction.\nYou will be treated in a safe and separate treatment area for all your emergencies not related to a contagious illness. We have and will maintain this safe zone at all times, even during a crisis.\n\n\nIf it is suspected you have a contagious illness, you will immediately be taken to a safe and separate evaluation-treatment area.\nWe also have a safe, separate evaluation and treatment areas for pediatric emergencies with its own separate entrance.\nFurther note that all staff will at all times wear masks and gloves and frequently wash their hands. Staff who register you will be behind a plexiglass shield to keep all safe and protected.\nOnly one caregiver is allowed with a patient. Caregivers will also be screened. To protect everyone’s safety, visitors will be limited and authorized on a case-by-case basis, depending on the emergency.\n\nWho will be screened and tested for COVID-19?\n\nAs a precaution, all patients and visitors will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms at all access points to the hospital and ambulatory sites.\nAs of April 24, all admitted patients are tested for COVID-19.\nTBHC has initiated antibody testing for all front-line employees.\nTelemedicine visits are available for patients, as well as COVID-19 screening.\n\nHave you cleaned the hospital well?Every room and public area in the hospital is cleaned and disinfected daily following a rigorous infection protocol. Patient, procedure and operating rooms are intensively cleaned and disinfected to the highest levels. The walls and floors are disinfected, and everything is stripped from the room. The crew sweeps through on a clockwise rotation to make sure nothing is missed. As a final layer of protection, each room is misted with a deep-cleaning chemical to kill any remaining virus.\nWhen are the TBHC ambulatory sites opening?\n\nAmbulatory sites are now open with modifications to ensure your safety.\nAppointments are being scheduled to assure that a safe number of patients are allowed in the waiting room at any one time and that social distancing can be maintained at all times by both patients and staff. Masks are required to be worn by all patients and those accompanying patients at the visit. All staff are wearing masks, as well.\nOnly one parent or caregiver is allowed with a patient, including one for an elderly or handicapped patient, and one to accompany a pregnant woman during prenatal visits.\nPatient exam rooms will be closely monitored throughout the day and disinfected as needed. The waiting areas and common areas will be cleaned and disinfected periodically during the day and each evening.\n\nWhat further assurances are there for non-COVID-19 patients who require elective surgeries or procedures at TBHC?\n\nAll staff working in pre-surgical testing and perioperative areas are being screened and tested for COVID antibodies.\nAll patients will be provided with an appropriate mask if they do not have one at their appointment.\nThere will be separate PACU (recovery) and nursing units for COVID-19 versus non-COVID patients\nTBHC has adequate and separate ICU capacity and staff for both COVID-19 and non-COVID patients.\nAll patients will be tested for COVID-19 48 hours before surgery/procedure.\n\nIf positive and symptomatic, the procedure will be rescheduled.\nIf positive and non-symptomatic, TBHC will proceed with the case.\n\n\n\nStay safe and be well,\nGary G. TerrinoniPresident and CEOThe Brooklyn Hospital Center\n\nUPDATE — May 4, 2020:Effective, May 4, the COVID-19 screening tent outside the emergency room will close.​ If you want to learn more about your risk for COVID-19 or have questions about testing, please call the Community Hotline at 718-250-8199.\n\nUPDATE — APRIL 15, 2020:TBHC Blood Bank is seeking plasma donors who have recovered from COVID-19. Anyone who has had COVID-19 may qualify to donate blood and participate in TBHCs \"convalescent plasma\" program for treatment of patients who are currently very ill. Those who have already had the infection usually have high quantities of antibodies in their blood, which are potentially a powerful weapon against the disease.​ To qualify, you must have had a positive test AND be asymptomatic for at least 14 days. You do not have to have a negative test to prove you have cleared the virus. Convalescent Plasma COVID-19 Donor Request Form.

Upon arrival, please respond to your appointment text with “here” and wait in your car until you receive further instruction.\n\n\nWhat are the differences between the antibody and molecular tests? \n\nCOVID-19 PCR molecular testing directly screens for the virus using a culture obtained from a nasal swab.  It indicates if a patient currently has the virus.  This test is available at all WellNow centers with results returned to the patient in 3-5 days.\nCOVID-19 rapid molecular or swab testing also directly indicates if a patient currently has the virus using a nasal swab. Results are returned to the patient in 15 minutes or less. This test is available at our Oswego and Oneonta centers, and administered using Abbott ID NOW.\nCOVID-19 rapid antigen testing indicates if a patient currently has the virus using a nasopharyngeal swab.  Results are returned to the patient in 15 minutes or less.  A confirmatory PCR test may be required, with results returned to the patient in 3-5 days.  This rapid test is available at all WellNow centers and administered using the CareStart™ antigen test by AccessBio.\nAntibody testing uses a blood sample to indirectly screen for COVID-19 by looking for antibodies produced as the body’s response to a COVID-19 infection.  A positive or negative result from antibody testing alone is not enough to confirm presence or absence of infection, ongoing infection and/or long-term immunity.  Results are returned to the patient within 3-5 days.\nThere is still much to be learned from this virus, and accordingly, patients should still practice social distancing, wearing masks, frequent hand washing, avoiding touching their face, and following all other local health department guidelines to help reduce the spread of the virus.  For more information regarding COVID-19, please visit the CDC.\n\nWho can receive a COVID-19 test at WellNow? \n\n\nTesting is available to anyone who has or recently had symptoms of COVID-19, or anyone who may have been exposed to someone confirmed positive for COVID-19, with no prescription required. A WellNow provider will see you to help determine which test is best for you.\n\nThe number of times you can be tested will be determined by a WellNow provider. After an evaluation, this decision will be based on your symptoms and their duration. Certain essential-services personnel may need to be tested more than once.\n\nHow much does COVID-19 testing cost at WellNow? \n\nTesting may be covered based on insurance coverage as part of the CARES Act.  Contact your insurance carrier for full details on your coverage.\nFor patients without insurance, testing costs $100 for the PCR swab test, $43 for the antibody test, and $60 for the rapid swab and antigen tests, all in addition to the charge for the base visit and any other necessary services.\nPlease note, at this time rapid testing is available for those whose insurance carrier currently reimburses WellNow for the full cost of the rapid test.\n\nHow long will it take to receive my COVID-19 testing results? \n\nResults for both the COVID-19 PCR swab test and antibody test will return within 3-5 days. Patients in New York can get their results by registering for an account at www.mybostonheart.com 2-3 days after the sample was taken.\nRapid testing is currently available at 11 of our locations with results in 15 minutes. A confirmatory PCR test may be required, which results in 3-5 days.\nIf after 7 days you are still unable to obtain your results or are experiencing trouble with the portal, please contact the WellNow center where you were tested so we can help provide more information Please note that all positive COVID-19 PCR swab test results will receive a direct phone call from one of our team members. Patients in Chicago will receive all results directly from WellNow.\n\nAre your centers following safety and sanitary guidelines? \n\nBecause your health is our priority, we are following all sanitary guidelines from the CDC and local health departments in our facilities with:\n\nReinforced disinfecting processes across all rooms, tables, chairs, computers, door handles and surfaces with EPA-registered cleaning products.\nProviding personal protective equipment (PPE) for our staff and requiring all patients to wear masks upon entering a WellNow center or we are happy to provide you with one.\nExpanded telehealth services and accepted insurances from WellNow Virtual Medical to ensure our providers are available for those who need or prefer to receive care from home.\n\n\nWhere is Rapid Testing available? \n\nAt this time, rapid testing is available at all WellNow centers.\nPlease note, if your rapid antigen test results negative, we are required to send a confirmatory PCR molecular test to our lab partner. For your convenience, we will swab you for both tests during your visit. The rapid antigen test will return results in 15 minutes and the confirmatory test will return results in 3-5 days.\nRapid Molecular testing is available at our centers in Oswego and Oneonta, with results available in 15 minutes.','No content','12110','800 Loudon Rd Latham, NY',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:06:37','2021-02-28 07:06:37','WellNow Urgent Care - Latham','NY','div|accordion-group'),(471,43,'https://www.seuhealth.com/covid-vaccine','','No content','84501','28 S 100 E, Price, UT 84501, Estados Unidos',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:15:37','2021-02-28 07:18:23','Southeastern Utah Health Department','UT','div|_2iB5S'),(472,31,'http://www.ellismedicine.org/covid19/staff.aspx','','No content','12110','800 Loudon Rd Latham, NY',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:17:59','2021-02-28 07:17:59','Ellis Hospital','NY','div|nav-color-bar'),(473,43,'https://slco.org/health/COVID-19/vaccine/','COVID Vaccine\n\nUpdated February 25, 2021\n\nPeople 65 and Older: Make a first-dose vaccine appointment.

These steps include clinical trials and reviews by many independent scientists, medical professionals, and public health experts. The COVID vaccine has undergone these rigorous steps, just like all vaccines; no steps were skipped or rushed. Learn more at ThisIsOurShot.com\n\n\n\nCost\n There is no cost to you to be vaccinated. If you have health insurance, vaccine providers (including Salt Lake County Health Department) may bill your insurance a vaccine administration fee. If you do not have insurance, you will not be charged.\n\n\n\nPrecautions\n It is important to continue following COVID precautions even after youve been vaccinated; it can take time after vaccination for the body to build its immune response. We will also need a large portion of our population vaccinated before we can begin phasing out face coverings, social distancing, and other infection prevention precautions—and that will take several months.\n\n\n\nMore Information\n \nFrequently Asked Questions about COVID Vaccine\nVaccine information from the Utah Department of Health.','No content','84088','7971 S 1825 W, West Jordan, UT 84088, Estados Unidos',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:19:24','2021-02-28 07:25:24','South Redwood Public Health Center','UT','div|order-first order-md-last col-sm-12 col-md-9 printFix'),(474,4,'https://www.pharmacarx.com/pharmaca-integrative-pharmacy-san-francisco-cole-valley/','No content','No content','94117','925 Cole Street San Francisco CA 94117',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:21:28','2021-02-28 07:21:28','Pharmaca Integrative Pharmacy','CA','div|post-593 page type-page status-publish hentry'),(475,4,'https://alto.com/','Believe in a better pharmacy.Transfer in seconds','No content','94107','1400 Tennessee St Unit 2 San Francisco, CA  94107',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:24:36','2021-02-28 07:24:36','Alto Pharmacy','CA','div|jsx-3354048094 c-footer-cta__main'),(476,43,'https://centralutahpublichealth.org/coronavirus-information/','To sign up to receive the COVID-19 vaccine please click here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n65+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Sign-up Form\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder 65 with health conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Sign-up Form\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFact Sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-Vaccination Checklist\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccine Registration','No content','84624','362 W Main St #1, Delta, UT 84624, Estados Unidos',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:24:54','2021-02-28 07:27:00','Central Utah Public Health Department (West Millard Office)','UT','div|fl-col-group fl-node-5eb97862572f1'),(477,43,'https://brhd.org/covid-19-vaccine-information/','No content','No content','84341','655 E 1300 N, Logan, UT 84341, Estados Unidos',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:27:32','2021-02-28 07:40:58','Bear River Health Department','UT','div|et_pb_column et_pb_column_1_2 et_pb_column_10  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough'),(478,4,'https://www.ucsfhealth.org/covid/vaccine','COVID-19 Information for Patients & Visitors \n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccines at UCSF Health','No content','94143','505 Parnassus Ave University Of California San Francisco, CA',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:39:36','2021-02-28 07:39:36','UCSF Medical Center','CA','div|component article-hero basic-hero'),(479,4,'https://www.sutterhealth.org/cpmc','No content','No content','94118','3700 California St San Francisco, CA  94118',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:44:43','2021-02-28 07:44:43','California Pacific Medical Center','CA','div|templatedata/config/businessrules/data/webadmin/content/article/article-provider-person-details;'),(481,4,'https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/12/14/sf-covid-update-vaccine-arrives-at-zuckerberg-san-francisco-general-hospital-surge-of-new-cases-tops-200-a-day/','SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — A batch of 2,000 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine arrived at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Monday morning as new cases of the virus continue to soar in the city, filling up beds in hospitals and intensive care units.\nCalling it a historical day, San Francisco Public Health Director Dr. Grant Colfax said vaccinations of front line health care workers at San Francisco General will begin immediately.\nREAD MORE: Bay Area Health Workers Cheer Newly-Approved 1-Shot Johnson & Johnson Vaccine\n\nCOVID Update: Newsom Urges Californians To Stay Vigilant As Vaccine Arrives; ‘Let’s Not Run The 90-Yard Dash’\n\n“Obviously, it is incredibly important to begin vaccinating people are quickly as possible,” he told reporters on a Zoom call.\nWhile the vaccine carries with it future hopes in the battle against the virus, Colfax said residents can’t lose sight of the current dire situation unfolding within San Francisco.\n“It will be a long (vaccine) rollout and too late for this surge,” he said.\nCurrently, San Francisco is grouped with hospitals in other Bay Area counties into one of five COVID ICU regions in the state. As of Monday, the availability of ICU beds had dropped from around 25 percent to 17.8 percent in just one week.\nWhile those numbers are alarming, they are not as bad as in other regions. Colfax said the greater Sacramento region had 14.8 percent, the Southern California region which includes San Diego and Los Angeles had just 2.7 percent and there were no available ICU beds in the San Joaquin Valley region.\n“America has lost more people due to COVID-19 than during World War II. Across the country, as many people are dying daily of COVID-19 as died on 9/11 and yet this surge continues with no signs of slowing,” Colfax said. “Cases are rapidly rising and hospital bed availability is shrinking across the state, the region and San Francisco…We expect demand over the next two weeks to increase.”\nHe said there were currently at least 2,807 active cases of COVID-19 among the residents of San Francisco. There were 148 COVID patients hospitalized in San Francisco, 37 of those are in intensive care.READ MORE: Antioch Gas Station Shooting Leaves Man Suffering Life-Threatening Injuries\nAnd the feared Thanksgiving surge was underway. New cases have increased by 50 percent after Thanksgiving and over last week an average of 200 people have tested positive each day.\n“With so much virus out there, you are not going to get away with any bad behavior,” he said.\nColfax warned that with hospitalizations lagging about two weeks behind infections. San Francisco will run out of ICU beds in the next 3-4 weeks.\n“I think it is important for us to step back for a moment and realize how dire out situation is,” he said. “At this point, many of us know or possibly have been diagnosed with COVID 19. And hopefully people have done okay. But despite that hope, unfortunately, many of us know people who have become very ill and died. Simply put this virus kills.”\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed tweeted about the arrival of the Pfizer vaccine Monday afternoon, saying “there is a light at the end of the tunnel.”\n\nSan Francisco will begin administering our first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine tomorrow morning, prioritizing our frontline healthcare workers.\nAlmost nine months after our first Stay at Home order, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.\n— London Breed (@LondonBreed) December 15, 2020MORE NEWS: Hundreds Rally in San Mateo to Denounce Violence Against Asian Americans','No content','94110','1001 Potrero Ave San Francisco, CA 94110',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 07:53:36','2021-02-28 07:53:36','Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center','CA','div|column-item story'),(482,4,'https://abc30.com/crmc-covid-vaccine-fresno-kenny-banh-ucsf-coronavirus/8962858/','No content','No content','93721','2823 Fresno Street Fresno, CA 93721',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 08:06:51','2021-02-28 08:06:51','UCSF Fresno Community Regional Medical Center','CA','div|fitt-analytics'),(483,4,'https://www.strosehospital.org/','No content','No content','94545','27200 CALAROGA AVE, HAYWARD, CA',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 08:39:28','2021-02-28 08:39:28','ST ROSE HOSPITAL','CA','div|feature-three'),(484,43,'https://sanjuanpublichealth.org/vaccine-data-information','No content','No content','84511','735 S 200 W #2, Blanding, UT 84511, Estados Unidos',1,NULL,'2021-02-28 08:43:08','2021-02-28 08:43:08','San Juan Public Health Department','UT','-'),(485,4,'https://www.sutterhealth.org/absmc/for-patients/health-alerts/covid-19-vaccine','Limited COVID-19 Vaccine Availability\nThough COVID-19 continues to affect all of us, there’s hope on the horizon.\n                  Weve administered over 300,000 doses through our clinics and large-scale sites.\n\nDue to extremely limited supply, were not scheduling\n                  first dose appointments.\nPlease don’t call your provider – they cant give the vaccine or exceptions.\n\nWe appreciate your patience.
